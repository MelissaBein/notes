View this post on Instagram           Monday morning I woke up without a client project for the first time in ten years. For most of my career, my goal was to build my client list. And that work paid off. Over the course of 11 years I’ve worked with over 80 clients. For most of the last decade, I loved client work. I loved the challenge of art direction, feedback and the back and forth toward something final. I loved working with art directors, who are mostly incredibly smart, hard working, kind people. I even grew to love a tight deadline. I feel so lucky that I got to work on so many incredible projects. But in the past few years I started to feel really tired and simultaneously disconnected from my own creativity. I have always made my own work amidst doing client work, so that wasn’t exactly the problem. I just wasn’t doing it with enough depth or any sense of abandon anymore because I didn’t have the time or energy. And I felt increasingly sad about that disconnect. Earlier this year I realized I needed — at least temporarily — to turn my attention back to my own process &amp; work, not just a little, but in full force. So with the exception of some book projects, I made a choice to stop making art for other people for awhile. This was not an easy decision. Client work is a huge part of my income. The relationships I have with some of my clients feel almost like family. Much of my own sense of success has been in direct relationship to the relative demand for my work, which has luckily been high. So if I stopped doing the thing I worked so hard at building over 10 years, who would I be? I started grappling with that question earlier this year. And I realized that my happiness, my connection to my well of creativity, was more important than my identity as a busy commercial illustrator. So I finished up the assignments I had before my vacation &amp; have stopped taking on new client projects. This summer &amp; fall I’m working on a couple books with generous timelines. I’ll continue to run my shops, teach &amp; speak . But I’m entering a new phase with enough space for exploration. And while I’m scared AF, I’m also ALL IN. Shaking things up feels good. ❤️ A post shared by  Lisa Congdon (@lisacongdon) on May 31, 2019 at 7:13am PDTThe phrase “all in” is really interesting to me, because it’s both exactly how I feel and also the opposite of how I feel. And this distinction is what fascinates me. How is it possible to go in “full force” while doing it “at least temporarily” and not trigger a paradox that destroys the universe?This year’s motto: All in &amp; with the flowTo be all in is to commit whole-heartedly to something. To go with the flow is to let the flow carry you where it may. To combine the two means to go all in with full force while it makes sense, and then to go all in with full force on the next thing that makes sense. And in order to do this there can’t be a lot of top-down structure in place limiting where force can be directed, or limiting where it can be redirected to. Maybe that’s creative freedom, and why it is tough to operationalize it in large structured groups like organizations, and why creative people need to exist in a loosely-connected interdependent sense with lots of people rather than participate in a rigid hierarchy optimized for efficiency and productivity at a specific task.ToolkitMy tool kit for being all in &amp; with the flow is:  Blog about non-professional things more (and write more newsletters)  Keep my beliefs up-to-date (be proactive rather than reactive)  Focus health-improvement on making it to my 100th birthday (a recent hypertension diagnosis is all the motivation I need)  Draw more (and don’t compare myself to other artists)  Don’t be afraid of selling things (I’m still afraid of selling things)  Build things that last (like 750 Words that turns 10 this year)  Keep dialogues open (I wrote a book about it, after all)  Reach out to people (independence requires interdependence)",

For most of my career, my goal was to build my client list. And that work paid off. Over the course of 11 years I’ve worked with over 80 clients. For most of the last decade, I loved client work. I loved the challenge of art direction, feedback and the back and forth toward something final. I loved working with art directors, who are mostly incredibly smart, hard working, kind people. I even grew to love a tight deadline. I feel so lucky that I got to work on so many incredible projects. But in the past few years I started to feel really tired and simultaneously disconnected from my own creativity. I have always made my own work amidst doing client work, so that wasn’t exactly the problem. I just wasn’t doing it with enough depth or any sense of abandon anymore because I didn’t have the time or energy. And I felt increasingly sad about that disconnect. Earlier this year I realized I needed — at least temporarily — to turn my attention back to my own process &amp; work, not just a little, but in full force. So with the exception of some book projects, I made a choice to stop making art for other people for awhile. This was not an easy decision. Client work is a huge part of my income. The relationships I have with some of my clients feel almost like family. Much of my own sense of success has been in direct relationship to the relative demand for my work, which has luckily been high. So if I stopped doing the thing I worked so hard at building over 10 years, who would I be? I started grappling with that question earlier this year. And I realized that my happiness, my connection to my well of creativity, was more important than my identity as a busy commercial illustrator. So I finished up the assignments I had before my vacation &amp; have stopped taking on new client projects. This summer &amp; fall I’m working on a couple books with generous timelines. I’ll continue to run my shops, teach &amp; speak . But I’m entering a new phase with enough space for exploration. And while I’m scared AF, I’m also ALL IN. Shaking things up feels good. ❤️</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisacongdon/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Lisa Congdon</a> (@lisacongdon) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-05-31T14:13:38+00:00\">May 31, 2019 at 7:13am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script><p>The phrase “all in” is really interesting to me, because it’s both exactly how I feel and also the opposite of how I feel. And this distinction is what fascinates me. How is it possible to go in “full force” while doing it “at least temporarily” and not trigger a paradox that destroys the universe?</p><h3 id=\"this-years-motto-all-in--with-the-flow\">This year’s motto: All in &amp; with the flow</h3><p>To be all in is to commit whole-heartedly to something. To go with the flow is to let the flow carry you where it may. To combine the two means to go all in with full force while it makes sense, and then to go all in with full force on the next thing that makes sense. And in order to do this there can’t be a lot of top-down structure in place limiting where force can be directed, or limiting where it can be redirected to. Maybe that’s creative freedom, and why it is tough to operationalize it in large structured groups like organizations, and why creative people need to exist in a loosely-connected interdependent sense with lots of people rather than participate in a rigid hierarchy optimized for efficiency and productivity at a specific task.</p><h3 id=\"toolkit\">Toolkit</h3><p>My tool kit for being all in &amp; with the flow is:</p><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://busterbenson.com/blog/\">Blog about non-professional things more</a> (and write more <a href=\"https://buster.substack.com/\">newsletters</a>)</li>  <li><a href=\"https://busterbenson.com/beliefs/\">Keep my beliefs up-to-date</a> (be proactive rather than reactive)</li>  <li><a href=\"https://busterbenson.com/the-life-of/buster/\">Focus health-improvement on making it to my 100th birthday</a> (a recent hypertension diagnosis is all the motivation I need)</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bustrbensn/\">Draw more</a> (and don’t compare myself to other artists)</li>  <li>Don’t be afraid of selling things (I’m still afraid of selling things)</li>  <li>Build things that last (like <a href=\"https://750words.com/\">750 Words</a> that turns 10 this year)</li>  <li>Keep dialogues open (I wrote a book about it, after all)</li>  <li>Reach out to people (independence requires interdependence)</li></ul><div class=\"image \"><img src=\"/assets/images/pieces/43-smell-flowers-1800x1350.jpeg\" alt=\"Smell the flowers\" caption=\"Smell the flowers\" srcset=\"/assets/images/pieces/43-smell-flowers-1800x1350.jpeg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/43-smell-flowers-1800x1350.jpeg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/43-smell-flowers-1800x1350.jpeg 3x\" /></div>",

My mom said that the “k” was also convenient because it maps to the hard “k” sounds in Japanese. My first name in Hiragana is:  えりっくAnd is pronounced eh-ri–ku.Keith was my father’s middle name and my grandfather’s middle name, and my grandfather went by Keith. Another call out to that side of the family, but I don’t know if it had any significance past that. Looking it up on family search, none of my grandfather’s other 12 (!) siblings had the middle name Keith, and I don’t see it showing up in generations previous to that either. I remember some kid making fun of my middle name when I was super young… he said it was a nerdy or otherwise awkward name, and I often made fun of my own middle name for years, probably as a self-defense mechanism to that. It’s weird how that is still attached to my relationship with that name.And Benson also comes from my father’s side. I wish I had some connection to my mom in my name… that K at the end of Erik isn’t really a whole lot to go on. Benson was given to Sven “Swanty” Johan Bengtsson when he immigrated to the US on September 27th, 1875, having been converted by Mormon missionaries (I think).Now for the fun part.In 2006 I was feeling a little crazy and one night drunkenly decided to change my name for a year. As a vacation from my identity. I was feeling a bit stagnant, I guess, and needed to shake things up. So I asked a bunch of people to help me choose a new name to use for a year, and also tried to recruit friends to do it with me.It was fun to ask:  What would it be like to be John for a year? Or a Timothy?I was part of a startup that helped build goals called 43things.com at the time (it’s gone now), and I posted this question to everyone.  What’s the point of changing my name? Well, now that the goal’s on my list, the point is to cross it off my list. Everything on your list has a point – that’s the magic.And on September 6th, 2006 I drove to city hall with a polar bear (someone I had met at a show who also wanted to change her name, but who always wore a polar bear costume and went by the name Vladmir the Polar Bear) and flipped a coin in the courtroom to choose between the two final contestants for my last name: Butterfield and McLeod. It landed on McLeod, so I made Butterfield my middle name, and also changed my first name to Buster which had come to me in a dream. In the dream I had opened a cafe called Buster’s Cafe, and that seemed as legit a reason to use that name as any other I would ever come up with.After a few questions from the judge, who found the whole endeavor rather silly, my legal name became Buster Butterfield McLeod. And a few months later another friend who also changed her last name to McLeod started a bar and art gallery in Seattle named McLeod Residence. That’s a whole separate story, but when I got married to Kellianne a few years later neither of us wanted to use our current last names for various reasons and we decided to to back to Benson. And I changed my middle name back to Keith, but kept the first name.The name I have today, Buster Keith Benson, is partially from my parents and partially from a dream. There’s a whole lot more to this story as well, but it’s best told over a beer.",

The new usage of “emotional labor” has gained currency as a way to describe the myriad unpaid jobs and responsibilities that people (many of them women) take on in families, offices, and communities.  In families, the term refers to the mental work required to keep a household running—all that scheduling and bill-paying and research—as well as the anxiety of being in charge of those thankless and largely invisibly tasks.  “Emotional labor” had a narrower meaning as it was originally conceived. In 1983, the Berkeley sociologist Arlie Hochschild coined the term in her book, The Managed Heart, to describe a component of some service industry jobs in which workers must project a different emotion than the one they are experiencing. The most often used example of this is a flight attendant tasked with maintaining an air of friendly calm, even amidst passenger complaints or turbulence (a notion that inspired an entire genre of Saturday Night Live skits). It’s a useful term, to describe a real phenomenon.The original definition of “emotional labor” is the work of separating your public expression of emotions from your private experience of emotions. Wow.  When academic terms escape into the wilderness and take on new meaning, the concepts and arguments they describe meet a broader audience. Solomon points to the idea of “intersectionality” as another modern example.  But now, “intersectional” is often used in a positive sense as in: an intersectional approach to activism, or an intersectional outlook.

It has a more wishy-washy line about not harming people, but it&#39;s not central or primary to the oath.&mdash; Buster (@buster) January 17, 2019Click through for the rest.This is a modern re-write of the Hippocratic Oath which is the version most adopted by doctors today.  I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:  I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.Okay, it’s good to be humble and acknowledge the mountain of science that every doctor stands upon.  I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures that are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.This is my favorite line in the oath because it acknowledges that it’s necessary to always find the right balance here, and there’s no hard line around treatment or no treatment that a medical philosophy can rest on.  I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon’s knife or the chemist’s drug.Another caveat to our instincts to reduce everything to facts and theories. You gotta be a human as well.  I will not be ashamed to say “I know not,” nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient’s recovery.More humility. More acceptance of the fact that we’re all human.  I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.I’m starting to think that there’s a big problem with a lack of humility in the medical profession. But this is a good reminder. Doctors don’t know everything. Nor can they save everyone.  I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person’s family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.Oh yeah, patients are humans too.  I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.But not as easy to take credit for. So another reminder to do things that get the outcome but avoid the credit, because they can be more effective.  I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.Yup, still a human!  If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.Enjoy life and leave the world better than you found it.",

Specifically, thoughts around how modern life is changing the way we relate and communicated to each other and causing all kinds of problems. Overall, this is a great read and also a great example of the value in articulating foundational beliefs and opinions.My highlights  The kind of background assumptions that float by unnoticed when you agree with them work very differently when you don’t.I love how this is articulated. Our confirmation bias against our cognitive dissonance… two sides of the same coin.  It’s interesting how so many things are implied and unsaid (and how, if you agree with these things, you don’t even notice). A writer may leave things unspecified for several reasons: they might not be aware of their own assumptions, they might think they are obvious, or they might just think the reader agrees. Or all three.I agree, and also the impracticality of actually being explicit about everything. Communication is already so difficult and low-bandwidth that we have to take advantage of unsaid things.  This works ok in the real world. It doesn’t work at all on the internet where voices are disembodied and spaces have ill-defined borders.Because in the real world we tend to have more history with the people we’re talking to. Not necessarily because of the medium.  It also encourages a shoot-first-ask-questions-later, “thorns out” approach to reading about contentious issues.I like “thorns out”.  It would be helpful if people writing online could point to some description of their fundamental beliefs, interests and assumptions, so you could get a better picture of who they are and where their writing is coming from [2].Yes!  But be warned, enumerating your own unstated basic beliefs was much harder than I thought it’d beVery true. We find that we have only glimmers of our own beliefs, and have to make them up more than discover them when we try to look for what they actually are.  That we have a particular kind of territory doesn’t mean we have to have a particular kind of map. There are many valid maps of the world.I love this.  some maps clearly hug the territory tighter than othersAnother great sentiment. I am just a big fan of the map/territory metaphor.  Thus, the structure and adoption of narratives shapes our collective worldviews and our societies, all the way up the chain from single words to full-blown paradigms. The struggle for the rights to shape them resembles war.Narrative shapes as distinct from facts. That sounds right to me. And the desire to protect and change our precious narrative shapes resonates as well.  the constant reshaping of our shared conceptual world by the process of discourse is a more important arena for rhetoric.100% agree!  Models, rules, and patterns have exceptions. That does not invalidate them. Outside of hard science, it’s rarely a good idea to make models and concepts much more complicated to chase a few outliers and edge cases.I find myself strongly disagreeing with this one. It seems too specific of a strategy to apply to all models, rules, and patterns. It was just said that the struggle to shape narratives can resemble war…  Intelligence tests measure something real, and it is significantly heritableI have lots of anxiety around this comment, as it’s very easy to misinterpret or magnify harmful stereotypes. That said, my only really caveat to it is that we should decouple what is real from what is fixed vs what is in constant flux. A snapshot of something real from a certain perspective captures a moment in time that may or may not change in quality and measurement in the future or since the past.  while there is a human nature, it manifests in different ways and is only observable as a highly garbled signal.Okay, this is likely the same point I was trying to make in the comment on #11.  In practice, there are, when assigning responsibility for life outcomes, two poles: one being a high-agency stance that treats individual freedom and responsbility as absolute, and the other a low-agency stance that treats choices as constrained so much by social structures that responsibility is best placed on the system as a whole[6][7]I’m going to nab this exact wording and add it to my beliefs file.  Way more social and political problems, dissatisfactions, internal dissonances etc. than we think stem from us living in very large (as opposed to small sub-dunbarian) societies+1  Everyone arguing has a point, even if often not a very strong one. Charity and civility in disagreement is an essential virtue, and make an effort to understand under what conditions something seemingly wrong would make sense. People are more different in how they see the world than we think, and we should practice telling ourselves stories that make the other sympathetic.Great one to end on.Read itGet a coffee and take 20-30 minutes to read it.

            "summary": null,
            "content_text": "My top take-away:When the argument is about a binary choice between only two option, consider re-framing the difference as something that exists along a spectrum, with more than two possible perspectives. Some perspectives will be about which direction we should push, relative to our current circumstances (aka equilibrium perspectives). Others will be about what kinds of absolute limits we should put into place regardless of current circumstances (aka limitation perspectives).My highlights:  We sometimes think of political issues in binary terms. Is someone pro-life or pro-choice? But most individuals hold views that are more complicated than a binary can capture.A fool’s choice. If you’re choosing between one thing or the other, expand the pool of considered options.  An alternative is to describe a given position on a spectrum.Yesssss.  Most political stances can be understood in terms of an equilibrium. For instance, some people might believe that access to abortion in a conservative state is too restricted under the status quo, and favor relaxing the rules regulating abortion clinics. That is, they might favor shifting the equilibrium in a “pro-choice” direction.The stance is relative to the current perceived status quo rather than an absolute position.  Some Americans would feel less polarized and alienated from their fellow citizens if they recognized that some of the people fighting on “the other side” of a polarizing issue actually hold values and beliefs that are strikingly similar to their own.A way to find common ground is to identify whether your position is about movement relative to status quo, or about an absolute limit at one end or the other.

            "content_text": "This is my 13th year of yearly birthday reflections. Here are the previous 12:  41: Seek endarkenment  40: Mind the loops  39: Make wiggle room  38: Cultivate quality time  37: More kiloslogs  36: Talk it out  35: Love the struggle  34: Cultivating the core  33: Frugal to the max  32: No problem  31: Double down  30: Higher highs and lower lowsI usually do these on my birthday at the end of May, but it’s now July. Whoops. Most (okay, all) of my energy is going into 3 things right now and for the foreseeable future: family, work (Patreon), book. Book, by virtue of being the most flexible, is taking the 3rd rank there, and is therefore the most behind. Meaning that, given time to think and write, which this post generally requires, there’s usually a higher urgency need to work on the book directly. Hence the delay. That’s my story.But, I know that self-reflection of the past and coming year is fundamental to actually being a productive and healthy contributor to family, work, and the book… so here we are.One notable thing about all of this is that my 3 priorities are converging more than they ever have in the past. I’m looking back at the mottos from last few years: cultivate quality time (38), make wiggle room (39), mind the loops (40), and seek endarkenment (40)… these are all links in the same chain that now turns out to be a universal mindset that applies to family, work, and writing. I guess that’s a convenient byproduct of systems thinking… eventually it all has to fit together into a single puzzle.To be more specific.It probably goes back further. My multi-decade long love of private journaling, constraints, unfiltered streams of consciousness, quantified self, and self-reflection are all links in the chain too. I remember journaling in college, and then writing in LiveJournal, and then doing morning pages, 8:36pm, and most recently doing my “Written on Bart” series, slowly circling around a hunch that somewhere below my thoughts was an invisible, interconnected web of ideas and meaning that were more interesting than the things that happened to bubble up to the surface of my mind and personal narrative.Writing 50 posts in between the time BART’s subway doors closed at either Ashby or El Cerrito Plaza station, and when they opened in SF on Civic Center or Powell, was like taking a shovel and digging deeper and deeper into the unprocessed portions of my brain.My coworker, Ben, and I were designing a 1-hour discussion for our product/eng/design offsite a few months back. As we were brainstorming, he told the story of a teacher (if my memory serves me) who gave the class, or maybe just him, advice to “Dig deeper” on a particular topic or assignment. It has rung in my ears since… dig deeper! The problems and answers are not out in the world, they’re inside us. Since Trump was elected, I’ve been struggling with how to respond, how to even interpret what is happening in the first place… but as tempting as it has been to blame him and Nazis and evil-doers for the world’s problems, I keep returning to a mistake that I made… I had been overly optimistic about the direction of the world (I had even bet a friend that we would win the presidency as well as a majority in the Senate and the House)… how embarrassingly wrong I was. My optimism creates a blind spot around how the world actually was. And now the blind spot has grabbed the spotlight. Now, I grieve for my inaccurate assessment of the country and the world… it was never right, and by being inaccurate it allowed problems to fester. Cultural debt leads to culture wars. I had not dug deep enough to realize this at the time. Going forward, perhaps I could do better.Niko helps me dig deeper too. Seeing the world through a child’s eyes, where nothing makes sense yet, but giant open questions are opened and resolved on an almost daily basis made me realize how many ideas and mental models we have that are unexamined simply because there’s consensus on them. Because an authority figure (in this case me) gave a confident answer. As I learned to dig deeper, maybe I could help him build those skills early, so that not every confident authority figure he runs into can just insert answers into his brain without examination. How might that even work? I would have to dig deeper to find out.Maybe I could write a systems thinking children’s book? Incidentally, my first proposal to the editor and agent I am now working with was a “Little Prince meets Star Trek meets Who Moved My Cheese” space fable. It had the bonus quality of being the first idea that felt like it might unite family and writing priorities. 20 first chapters and book proposals later, I got a deal that seemed too good to be true! It’s no longer a space fable but it still unites family, and writing, and work too!But work (at Twitter, then Slack) remained unintegrated from the other direction, like the stubborn force of gravity that refuses to link up with the Grand Theory of Everything. How might work add value to writing?A few months later, Patreon floats past my view and I realize that’s the solution! Working with creators: podcasters, YouTubers, webcomic artists, illustrators, writers, and all manner of niche creative types who are also trying to unify their lives under a single Grand Theory! Gravity, however, remains unintegrated as far as I know.So yeah, this last year, I signed a book deal with Portfolio (an imprint of Penguin Random House) to write a book about arguing. Why arguing? Well, arguing is something that applies to every field of interest, and also pretty much every moment of every day. Family, work, craft, and self. To argue is to be human. Arguing is generally not considered to be quality time, except that sometimes, as if by freak accident, it creates the best quality time… conflict brings resolution. The heat of argument is not so different from the passion to live meaningfully. We argue because we care! Arguing makes us wiggle, and gets us nervous, and yet arguments are also sign posts for interesting conversations that we really should be having. Even if they aren’t the conversations we want to have. To be frank, we want to change other people, prove their idiocy wrong, shame their maliciousness, and silence their unproductive dissent. We’re motivated to confirm our own positions, and to ignore any evidence to the contrary. We surround ourselves with people who feel the same. We use zingers to keep our spirits up and taunt the enemy, and to get a laugh while stinging our enemies.That unproductive kind of arguing, and digging deeper, could not be more different in spirit and execution. But how to flip it to something productive? This has been my obsession this last year.Last year’s motto: seek endarkenmentEndarkenment is the opposite of enlightenment.If enlightenment is getting the answer, endarkenment is walking into the uncertainty of an open question. A dark room. If enlightenment is having all the evidence and data to prove that you’re right, endarkenment is the doubt of not knowing if you are right or if you just fear that you aren’t right and so are signaling confidence to brute force your way out of the problem.If enlightenment is the Obama presidency, endarkenment is the Trump presidency.If enlightenment is getting degrees, making money, setting up a matched 401K, angel investing, and getting invited to all the cool parties, endarkenment is wondering if you should opt out of the entire scene and move to a small island, and live with monkeys.Enlightenment is fighting for truth. Endarkenment is wondering if you’re even on the right side.It can get a bit dark. It’s endarkenment!Motto for my 42nd year: dig deeperThis is a continuation of my now 4-year interest into systems thinking, quality time, and cognitive biases. Jack posed a question on Twitter recently:What are the best books you’ve read on critical thinking? And why? https://t.co/iRMx0qGaGw&mdash; jack (@jack) June 29, 2018Lots of solid answers in the replies. Critical thinking and cognitive biases are my jam. Not because I’m any better at it than others, but maybe a little bit because I know how bad I am at it.Over a million people have now “read” my post that claims to be a cognitive bias cheat sheet. It’s been translated a bunch and used in classes, papers, and books all over the world. It’s weird, given that I just summarized a Wikipedia page. But it’s also not weird. The accidental secret to its success is that it takes advantage of all 4 bias categories:  There are several hundred cognitive biases (too many), so reducing them to 4 basic problems helps filter out the noise.  There’s no satisfying theory that unites all biases (not enough meaning), so I made one up that wasn’t “because brains suck” but a bit more friendly and forgiving “our brains are doing their darn best”.  Nobody actually has time to devote to immersing themselves in the nuances of biases, so now you can just bookmark this cheat sheet and share it with friends. Done.  Our attention and memories are like a school of baby penguins gripping a slippery sheet of ice in a category-5 hurricane. Even a bookmark is too hard to keep track of. Here’s a phone lock screen to hold onto as the waves of distractions constantly crash onto you.Asking for critical thinking tips on Twitter is a bit like having 24-hours left to live and spending it searching for a 1-day course on how to spend the last day of your life.It’s okay though.I don’t mean to pick on Jack, because we all do this. That’s the point! We’re all part of a wiggling universe that is extremely worried that it’s not good enough. We spend our last days on Earth looking for ways to signal to ourselves and others that we’ve at least put in sufficient time worrying about this problem. The hope being that we’ll then feel good enough, and give ourselves permission to do other more pleasant things.So when I say I want to dig deeper, it’s not to reach enlightenment. It’s to reach endarkenment, where I can appreciate being part of a universe that doesn’t think in terms of good enough or not, because obviously we all are. Instead I want to dig deeper in terms of appreciating the world as it is, grieving the loss of wishful thinking about how we wanted the world to be, and enthusiastically participating in the tiny patch that we find ourselves in, while we last. Maybe on a small island with monkeys. Maybe we’re already there.I love these monkeys. Some who can’t keep their pants up while bouncing on beds.Some who are quickly developing their own complex inner narratives of life on monkey island:And of course this lovely monkey I have enlisted to enthusiastically participate with most closely, approaching 10 years now:Family, work, book. These are the shadows cast by my life now past its 42nd year, the first year of life that extends further than my own father’s was able.“Everything we see is a shadow cast by that which we don’t see.” — Martin Luther King JrTo digging deeper, friends. 🍻",

Whoops. Most (okay, all) of my energy is going into 3 things right now and for the foreseeable future: family, work (Patreon), book. Book, by virtue of being the most flexible, is taking the 3rd rank there, and is therefore the most behind. Meaning that, given time to think and write, which this post generally requires, there’s usually a higher urgency need to work on the book directly. Hence the delay. That’s my story.</p><p>But, I know that self-reflection of the past and coming year is fundamental to actually being a productive and healthy contributor to family, work, and the book… so here we are.</p><p>One notable thing about all of this is that my 3 priorities are converging more than they ever have in the past. I’m looking back at the mottos from last few years: cultivate quality time (38), make wiggle room (39), mind the loops (40), and seek endarkenment (40)… these are all links in the same chain that now turns out to be a universal mindset that applies to family, work, and writing. I guess that’s a convenient byproduct of systems thinking… eventually it all has to fit together into a single puzzle.</p><p>To be more specific.</p><p>It probably goes back further. My multi-decade long love of private journaling, constraints, unfiltered streams of consciousness, quantified self, and self-reflection are all links in the chain too. I remember journaling in college, and then writing in LiveJournal, and then doing morning pages, 8:36pm, and most recently doing my “<a href=\"https://writtenonbart.com/\">Written on Bart</a>” series, slowly circling around a hunch that somewhere below my thoughts was an invisible, interconnected web of ideas and meaning that were more interesting than the things that happened to bubble up to the surface of my mind and personal narrative.</p><p>Writing 50 posts in between the time BART’s subway doors closed at either Ashby or El Cerrito Plaza station, and when they opened in SF on Civic Center or Powell, was like taking a shovel and digging deeper and deeper into the unprocessed portions of my brain.</p><p>My coworker, Ben, and I were designing a 1-hour discussion for our product/eng/design offsite a few months back. As we were brainstorming, he told the story of a teacher (if my memory serves me) who gave the class, or maybe just him, advice to “Dig deeper” on a particular topic or assignment. It has rung in my ears since… dig deeper! The problems and answers are not out in the world, they’re inside us. Since Trump was elected, I’ve been struggling with how to respond, how to even interpret what is happening in the first place… but as tempting as it has been to blame him and Nazis and evil-doers for the world’s problems, I keep returning to a mistake that I made… I had been overly optimistic about the direction of the world (I had even bet a friend that we would win the presidency as well as a majority in the Senate and the House)… how embarrassingly wrong I was. My optimism creates a blind spot around how the world actually was. And now the blind spot has grabbed the spotlight. Now, I grieve for my inaccurate assessment of the country and the world… it was never right, and by being inaccurate it allowed problems to fester. Cultural debt leads to culture wars. I had not dug deep enough to realize this at the time. Going forward, perhaps I could do better.</p><p>Niko helps me dig deeper too. Seeing the world through a child’s eyes, where nothing makes sense yet, but giant open questions are opened and resolved on an almost daily basis made me realize how many ideas and mental models we have that are unexamined simply because there’s consensus on them. Because an authority figure (in this case me) gave a confident answer. As I learned to dig deeper, maybe I could help him build those skills early, so that not every confident authority figure he runs into can just insert answers into his brain without examination. How might that even work? I would have to dig deeper to find out.</p><p>Maybe I could write a systems thinking children’s book? Incidentally, my first proposal to the editor and agent I am now working with was a “Little Prince meets Star Trek meets Who Moved My Cheese” space fable. It had the bonus quality of being the first idea that felt like it might unite family and writing priorities. 20 first chapters and book proposals later, I got a deal that seemed too good to be true! It’s no longer a space fable but it still unites family, and writing, and work too!</p><p>But work (at Twitter, then Slack) remained unintegrated from the other direction, like the stubborn force of gravity that refuses to link up with the Grand Theory of Everything. How might work add value to writing?</p><p>A few months later, Patreon floats past my view and I realize that’s the solution! Working with creators: podcasters, YouTubers, webcomic artists, illustrators, writers, and all manner of niche creative types who are also trying to unify their lives under a single Grand Theory! Gravity, however, remains unintegrated as far as I know.</p><p>So yeah, this last year, I signed a book deal with Portfolio (an imprint of Penguin Random House) to <a href=\"http://patreon.com/buster\">write a book about arguing</a>.

I wouldn’t have guessed that Medium would remain my publishing platform of choice for longer than all of the others (other than maybe LiveJournal, which extends back to at least 2002). But here we are! I’m thankful for Medium and am happy to be an early adopter of their new membership experiment. Long live Medium!In my Life by Weeks chart on busterbenson.com, two events stood out from the rest: Louie Phoenix Benson was born on August 6th, and Trump was elected on November 8th. They were quite different in terms of how I reacted to them. I also started writing a book about how to draw better conclusions while avoiding bias, and took on a lead role at Slack for the platform team.Last year’s motto: mind the loopsThe last year really was a lot about minding the loops. The now see feedback loops, and systems, and cycles everywhere I look.  In product development: What’s the right way to empower a messaging, communication, and workflow ecosystem to build businesses on other businesses? A system like this needs aligned incentives amongst a lot of different individuals, consistency, and trust.  In management: How can I mentor and manage people at different parts of their careers? A career is a learning, testing, and iterating system with many different phases, breaks, setbacks, opportunities.  In relationships: What’s the best way to be a good father to a newborn, and a 6 year old, and how can I be a good husband and partner? A relationship is a system with loops on many different time scales.  In creativity: What’s the best way to frame a creative project, like a book? Any form of exploration, discovery, and articulation is a system that requires a balance of seeking questions and answers, drafts and edits, proposals and agreements.It’s really true that the world isn’t linear — it’s loopy! But the loops are so intricate, often untraceable, and interdependent, that minding them is only enjoyable if I also let myself get lost in them a bit. I mind them in the same way I mind the stars, and long distances of space and time… appreciating the glimpses I get, but not really getting to the bottom of anything. A loop has no bottom.In the small glimpses I get, though, there’s a piece of the loops that has begun to stand out to me and it’s helped me understand why some systems are so difficult to understand or see. There’s often a stage within any system where things lose cohesion, or visibility, for extended periods. When a loop or a system gets tough to follow.  In the water cycle, water can get stuck in the ocean, or underground, for millennia before resurfacing and dancing through clouds, streams, animals, and plants.  In the life cycle, the part where we die and our bodies turn back into dirt, and that dirt spends hundreds or thousands of years working through the occasional worm digestive track, and each individual mineral or atom ends up in one of a billion different plants, animals, and geographic elements before dispersing again… that sort of makes the cycle difficult to follow and truly picture.Most cycles have a dark part. And darkness is generally not sought out, or invited into our explanations. We prefer ideas that sit nicely in an Occam’s Razor type of articulation. In the 4 conundrums model of how we understand the world, we filter out the dark parts of the world early and often.And yet. The dark part is so crucial. Without the vastness of empty space, everything would just be a giant ball of burning flames that crushed itself under its own weight. We need that darkness to create some sense of separation so that things can operate independently long enough to do something interesting. It’s only through extended separation that different species evolve. It’s only through the vast spaces between your brain and mine that we can think of each other as different people.And then there’s the darkness of the world. With Trump in power, the darkness feels a bit overwhelming, and it’s obviously natural to want this era of darkness to end. But the pressure of that darkness is the churning motivation that will fuel the next era, whatever that is.My father died in the same year of his life that I’m entering of my own right now. I’m still recovering from that, and still resist attempting to imagine what it must have been like to say goodbye to wife and a son and a daughter, not to mention goodbye to one’s self.This year’s motto: seek endarkenmentThink about it. The light is where everything is seen and understood (or where we at least think it is). Things make sense. There’s a shared understanding. A plan. But what do our eyes do in the light? Our pupils constrict. They narrow. And we get accustomed to the light and prefer to stay in it, where things are all figured out.On the other hand, the dark is where things can’t be seen. Especially when you’ve been in the light for a while. There is no plan. Nothing makes sense. But our pupils dilate and slowly adjust… there’s a seeking, a deep desire for exploration, curiosity, and we rely heavily on any tools or people around us to help us figure out what’s going on.If enlightenment is the desirable end state where everything has been brought into perfect clarity, endarkenment is the moment when we become comfortable in the darkness, in the lack of perfect clarity, when we’ve realize that we’re moving backwards, that we were wrong about a whole lot of things. Where we open our pupils, exposing ourselves to possible additional damage, but even so confidently seek the help of others because we need them.Even with everything going on in the world with Trump, and hate, and backwards progress, in the spirit of seeking endarkenment I feel like my only path forward is to accept that we messed up. We became so obsessed with progress, and advancement, that we didn’t get everyone on the wagon. Not by a long shot. A huge chunk of the world isn’t progressing, isn’t advancing, even amongst the people we have around us, and it’s our fault for leaving them behind. Instead of spending hours every day reading about the latest terrible thing Trump has done, let’s instead start thinking about how we begin to include the people who have had the same salary for 20 years, even while everything has gotten more expensive and more inaccessible. Let’s seek endarkenment on this and see where it goes.In the darkHere’s a some things I am a bit in the dark about at the moment, and am curious to see where they lead:  What kind of human will Louie grow into this year?  Is my book going to be any good? Am I going to make progress?  How will work culture and momentum continue to evolve?  What will happen to this country?  How can I enable improvement and better outcomes in the above things?  How do I make sure I stay healthy and happy and connected to the important people in my life along the way?It’s tempting to interpret discomfort in the dark as motivation to find the nearest answer. It’s a bit of an extension of the Spotlight Effect (where we only look for answers in areas that we feel clarity about). When we find ourselves in the dark, we assume the first answer/explanation we find is the right one. Instead, I’d like to sit in the dark a bit longer, let my eyes adjust a bit more, and wait for new information to slowly reveal itself, even if it’s quiet at first, and feels different than the answers I’m used to finding.To that end, I’m going to be spending a bit more time this year refactoring my codex. I’m testing having it hosted in a slightly more readable place in GitBook, which is pretty perfect for this use case.If you are interested in downloading my Book of Beliefs in an ebook format, you can let me know if this is useful at all by trying these links and letting me know how it goes: Kindle version, iBooks version.I think I’ve sufficiently over-engineered my yearly report post.

I wouldn’t have guessed that Medium would remain my publishing platform of choice for longer than all of the others (other than maybe LiveJournal, which extends back to at least 2002). But here we are! I’m thankful for Medium and am happy to be an early adopter of their new membership experiment. Long live Medium!</p></blockquote><p>In my <strong>Life by Weeks</strong> chart on busterbenson.com, two events stood out from the rest: Louie Phoenix Benson was born on August 6th, and Trump was elected on November 8th. They were quite different in terms of how I reacted to them. I also started writing a book about <a href=\"https://medium.com/thinking-is-hard/4-conundrums-of-intelligence-2ab78d90740f\">how to draw better conclusions while avoiding bias</a>, and took on a lead role at Slack for the platform team.</p><h3 id=\"last-years-motto-mind-the-loops\">Last year’s motto: mind the loops</h3><p>The last year really was a lot about <a href=\"/2016/05/28/mind-the-loop\">minding the loops</a>. The now see feedback loops, and systems, and cycles everywhere I look.</p><ul>  <li><strong>In product development:</strong> What’s the right way to empower a messaging, communication, and workflow ecosystem to build businesses on other businesses? A system like this needs aligned incentives amongst a lot of different individuals, consistency, and trust.</li>  <li><strong>In management:</strong> How can I mentor and manage people at different parts of their careers? A career is a learning, testing, and iterating system with many different phases, breaks, setbacks, opportunities.</li>  <li><strong>In relationships:</strong> What’s the best way to be a good father to a newborn, and a 6 year old, and how can I be a good husband and partner? A relationship is a system with loops on many different time scales.</li>  <li><strong>In creativity:</strong> What’s the best way to frame a creative project, like a book? Any form of exploration, discovery, and articulation is a system that requires a balance of seeking questions and answers, drafts and edits, proposals and agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>It’s really true that the world isn’t linear — it’s loopy!</strong> But the loops are so intricate, often untraceable, and interdependent, that minding them is only enjoyable if I also let myself get lost in them a bit. I mind them in the same way I mind the stars, and long distances of space and time… appreciating the glimpses I get, but not really getting to the bottom of anything. A loop has no bottom.</p><p>In the small glimpses I get, though, there’s a piece of the loops that has begun to stand out to me and it’s helped me understand why some systems are so difficult to understand or see. There’s often a stage within any system where things lose cohesion, or visibility, for extended periods. When a loop or a system gets tough to follow.</p><ul>  <li><strong>In the water cycle,</strong> water can get stuck in the ocean, or underground, for millennia before resurfacing and dancing through clouds, streams, animals, and plants.</li>  <li><strong>In the life cycle,</strong> the part where we die and our bodies turn back into dirt, and that dirt spends hundreds or thousands of years working through the occasional worm digestive track, and each individual mineral or atom ends up in one of a billion different plants, animals, and geographic elements before dispersing again… that sort of makes the cycle difficult to follow and truly picture.</li></ul><p><strong>Most cycles have a dark part.</strong> And darkness is generally not sought out, or invited into our explanations. We prefer ideas that sit nicely in an Occam’s Razor type of articulation. In the 4 conundrums model of how we understand the world, we filter out the dark parts of the world early and often.</p><p>And yet. The dark part is so crucial. Without the vastness of empty space, everything would just be a giant ball of burning flames that crushed itself under its own weight. We need that darkness to create some sense of separation so that things can operate independently long enough to do something interesting. It’s only through extended separation that different species evolve. It’s only through the vast spaces between your brain and mine that we can think of each other as different people.</p><p>And then there’s the darkness of the world. With Trump in power, the darkness feels a bit overwhelming, and it’s obviously natural to want this era of darkness to end. But the pressure of that darkness is the churning motivation that will fuel the next era, whatever that is.</p><p>My father died in the same year of his life that I’m entering of my own right now. I’m still recovering from that, and still resist attempting to imagine what it must have been like to say goodbye to wife and a son and a daughter, not to mention goodbye to one’s self.</p><h3 id=\"this-years-motto-seek-endarkenment\">This year’s motto: seek endarkenment</h3><p>Think about it. The light is where everything is seen and understood (or where we at least think it is). Things make sense. There’s a shared understanding. A plan. But what do our eyes do in the light? Our pupils constrict. They narrow. And we get accustomed to the light and prefer to stay in it, where things are all figured out.</p><p>On the other hand, the dark is where things can’t be seen. Especially when you’ve been in the light for a while. There is no plan. Nothing makes sense. But our pupils dilate and slowly adjust… there’s a seeking, a deep desire for exploration, curiosity, and we rely heavily on any tools or people around us to help us figure out what’s going on.</p><p>If enlightenment is the desirable end state where everything has been brought into perfect clarity, endarkenment is the moment when we become comfortable in the darkness, in the lack of perfect clarity, when we’ve realize that we’re moving backwards, that we were wrong about a whole lot of things. Where we open our pupils, exposing ourselves to possible additional damage, but even so confidently seek the help of others because we need them.</p><p>Even with everything going on in the world with Trump, and hate, and backwards progress, in the spirit of seeking endarkenment I feel like my only path forward is to accept that we messed up. We became so obsessed with progress, and advancement, that we didn’t get everyone on the wagon. Not by a long shot. A huge chunk of the world isn’t progressing, isn’t advancing, even amongst the people we have around us, and it’s our fault for leaving them behind. Instead of spending hours every day reading about the latest terrible thing Trump has done, let’s instead start thinking about how we begin to include the people who have had the same salary for 20 years, even while everything has gotten more expensive and more inaccessible. Let’s seek endarkenment on this and see where it goes.</p><hr /><h3 id=\"in-the-dark\">In the dark</h3><p>Here’s a some things I am a bit in the dark about at the moment, and am curious to see where they lead:</p><ul>  <li>What kind of human will Louie grow into this year?</li>  <li>Is my book going to be any good? Am I going to make progress?</li>  <li>How will work culture and momentum continue to evolve?</li>  <li>What will happen to this country?</li>  <li>How can I enable improvement and better outcomes in the above things?</li>  <li>How do I make sure I stay healthy and happy and connected to the important people in my life along the way?</li></ul><p>It’s tempting to interpret discomfort in the dark as motivation to find the nearest answer. It’s a bit of an extension of the Spotlight Effect (where we only look for answers in areas that we feel clarity about). When we find ourselves in the dark, we assume the first answer/explanation we find is the right one. Instead, I’d like to sit in the dark a bit longer, let my eyes adjust a bit more, and wait for new information to slowly reveal itself, even if it’s quiet at first, and feels different than the answers I’m used to finding.</p><hr /><p>To that end, I’m going to be spending a bit more time this year refactoring my <a href=\"/beliefs\">codex</a>. I’m testing having it hosted in a slightly more readable place in GitBook, which is pretty perfect for this use case.</p><p>If you are interested in downloading my Book of Beliefs in an ebook format, you can let me know if this is useful at all by trying these links and letting me know how it goes: Kindle version, iBooks version.</p><p>I think I’ve sufficiently over-engineered my yearly report post. Have a nice day!</p><p>https://twitter.com/buster/status/868917057353465856</p>",

Here are the previous 10:  39: Make wiggle room  38: Cultivate quality time  37: More kiloslogs  36: Talk it out  35: Love the struggle  34: Cultivating the core  33: Frugal to the max  32: No problem  31: Double down  30: Higher highs and lower lowsLife by weeksEvery week of my life is represented as a colored box on busterbenson.com. The last green box is this week. The last white box is where (very roughly) my life is predicted to end. And there are 100 rows since my life goal is to ride a bike on my 100th birthday.Life moves fast, but it also moves slow. Every year (if I’m lucky) I get a new row. In the last few months, I’ve heard from a half dozen friends who are going through such difficult times (cancer, mental illness, unpredictable health incidents, etc) and right now especially, each box of this chart feels all the more tangible.Today I turn 40. My father died when he was 41. This year, Niko is 6 and a new baby will be added to our family in a couple months.Life is still just getting started. And yet, it is also at a point where the end doesn’t feel so far away.We&#39;re all in this together. 👶🎢☠&mdash; Buster Benson (@buster) April 26, 2016Here’s a neat simulation of when my life might end, according to data from the CDC. A 2% chance of dying in the next 10 years, 9% chance in the next 20 years, and somewhere a bit over a 90% chance that I won’t make it to 100.But how will I die? At this point, heart disease and external causes (like car accidents) are my most threatening factors. Cancer is creeping up though, and is probably a bit higher than represented here due to my family’s history with it.Causes of death (try it)Talking about death and appreciating life go hand in hand. Yeah, it’s all a bit morbid, but it’s all part of the story here, might as well acknowledge it.Update to last year’s motto: make wiggle roomLast year, my birthday motto was to make wiggle room… which was my code word for finding the areas of my day, week, etc that could be turned into quality time. My commute was the biggest part of my day that had wiggle room potential, and I did a lot of writing on BART. In fact, near the end of that process, I began to realize that many of the things I was writing about were converging around an obsession with systems thinking, and I started planning a choose-your-own-adventure style book that would help teach systems thinking to Niko (and myself). Systems thinking is all about thinking about the loops: feedback loops, virtuous cycles, vicious cycles, karma, stock and flows, etc. If you aren’t sure what I’m talking about, this talk by Nicky Case does a fantastic job of explaining some of the most interesting bits of it.Here’s a 3-slide summary of his talk:The whole talk is great.In short:  The world is not linear, it’s loopy!In addition to my commute, I found some wiggle room in the time in the evenings when Kellianne usually watch television and relax from the day. I still enjoy spending time with Kellianne, and relaxing, but now I have started drawing and working on this book as well (which is just being posted to Instagram a page at a time with the #lifeofclodia tag).This year’s motto: mind the loopsI will continue my obsession with systems and loops this year, as several different parts of my life all contribute to the next row in my life by weeks chart.Years: Every year is one loop around the sun. I share a birthday with Ted Rheingold and his birthday post today expressed this thought in a deeply moving way.Family: When this new baby is my age, I’ll be 80! I wonder what he’ll do on his 40th birthday. I’m trying to remember what my father did on his 40th birthday, but can’t and need to ask my sister and mom about it. These loops need to be traced!People: I just want to appreciate the brief time we have with friends and family… whether you are healthy or sick, happy or sad, doing really well or struggling mightily, I am grateful for you and would love to spend some quality time with you this year. We are all looping through life, together.Work: At work, the mission is to make the working lives of people simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. And a prerequisite to doing that is also caring about our own work lives in that same way. The attitude towards work makes the product, and the product makes the attitude towards work.Interests: Choose your own adventure stories are loopy, not linear. My book won’t have any endings, every branch will return back into the book in some way. The reward here is really just sharing each page with Niko and Kellianne, getting feedback, and making new pages.Codex: My core beliefs inform my actions, and my actions inform my core beliefs. Every year I revisit my list of beliefs and make sure they’re up-t0-date and capture all the things that I’ve recently been thinking about. Next weekend I’ll be spending a couple days with a few close friends and I want to discuss these beliefs in more detail… I’ll have a bigger update about that soon.10 years ago, I had a polar bear, live interpretive painting, Reggie Watts and Daniel Spils playing weird music, embarrassing interviews on stage, a raffle for a hot air balloon ride, and lots of other absurdity:Credit: Josh SantangeloThis year, I had a really nice long walk with Kellianne, a delicious brunch, and plan a relaxing weekend of napping, drawing, house-work, and writing.Credit: KellianneAnd it is all good.

Yeah, it’s all a bit morbid, but it’s all part of the story here, might as well acknowledge it.</p><h3 id=\"update-to-last-years-motto-make-wiggle-room\">Update to last year’s motto: make wiggle room</h3><p>Last year, my birthday motto was to make wiggle room… which was my code word for finding the areas of my day, week, etc that could be turned into quality time. My commute was the biggest part of my day that had wiggle room potential, and I did a lot of <a href=\"http://writtenonbart.com/\">writing on BART</a>. In fact, near the end of that process, I began to realize that many of the things I was writing about were converging around an obsession with systems thinking, and I started planning a choose-your-own-adventure style book that would help teach systems thinking to Niko (and myself). Systems thinking is all about thinking about the loops: feedback loops, virtuous cycles, vicious cycles, karma, stock and flows, etc. If you aren’t sure what I’m talking about, this talk by Nicky Case does a fantastic job of explaining some of the most interesting bits of it.</p><p>Here’s a 3-slide summary of his talk:</p><div class=\"image \"><img src=\"/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy-800x450.png\" alt=\"Life by weeks\" caption=\"Life by weeks\" srcset=\"/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy-800x450.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy-800x450.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy-800x450.png 3x\" /></div><div class=\"image \"><img src=\"/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy2-800x450.png\" alt=\"Life by weeks\" caption=\"Life by weeks\" srcset=\"/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy2-800x450.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy2-800x450.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy2-800x450.png 3x\" /></div><div class=\"image \"><img src=\"/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy3-800x450.png\" alt=\"Life by weeks\" caption=\"Life by weeks\" srcset=\"/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy3-800x450.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy3-800x450.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy3-800x450.png 3x\" /></div><p>The <a href=\"http://ncase.me/OVC2016/\">whole talk is great</a>.</p><p>In short:</p><blockquote>  <p>The world is not linear, it’s loopy!In addition to my commute, I found some wiggle room in the time in the evenings when Kellianne usually watch television and relax from the day. I still enjoy spending time with Kellianne, and relaxing, but now I have started drawing and working on this book as well (which is just being posted to Instagram a page at a time with the #lifeofclodia tag).</p></blockquote><h3 id=\"this-years-motto-mind-the-loops\">This year’s motto: mind the loops</h3><p>I will continue my obsession with systems and loops this year, as several different parts of my life all contribute to the next row in my life by weeks chart.</p><p>Years: Every year is one loop around the sun. I share a birthday with Ted Rheingold and <a href=\"https://medium.com/season-of-the-witch/46th-orbit-around-the-sun-342a4c736385#.m1pk7qctg\">his birthday post</a> today expressed this thought in a deeply moving way.</p><p><strong>Family:</strong> When this new baby is my age, I’ll be 80! I wonder what he’ll do on his 40th birthday. I’m trying to remember what my father did on his 40th birthday, but can’t and need to ask my sister and mom about it. These loops need to be traced!</p><p><strong>People:</strong> I just want to appreciate the brief time we have with friends and family… whether you are healthy or sick, happy or sad, doing really well or struggling mightily, I am grateful for you and would love to spend some quality time with you this year. We are all looping through life, together.</p><p><strong>Work:</strong> At work, the mission is to make the working lives of people simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. And a prerequisite to doing that is also caring about our own work lives in that same way. The attitude towards work makes the product, and the product makes the attitude towards work.</p><p><strong>Interests:</strong> Choose your own adventure stories are loopy, not linear. My book won’t have any endings, every branch will return back into the book in some way. The reward here is really just sharing each page with Niko and Kellianne, getting feedback, and making new pages.</p><p><strong>Codex:</strong> My core beliefs inform my actions, and my actions inform my core beliefs. Every year I revisit my list of beliefs and make sure they’re up-t0-date and capture all the things that I’ve recently been thinking about. Next weekend I’ll be spending a couple days with a few close friends and I want to discuss these beliefs in more detail… I’ll have a bigger update about that soon.</p><p>10 years ago, I had a polar bear, live interpretive painting, Reggie Watts and Daniel Spils playing weird music, embarrassing interviews on stage, a raffle for a hot air balloon ride, and lots of other absurdity:</p><div class=\"image \"><img src=\"/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-vladmir-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"Vladmir the polar bear\" caption=\"Vladmir the polar bear\" srcset=\"/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-vladmir-1024x768.jpeg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-vladmir-1024x768.jpeg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-vladmir-1024x768.jpeg 3x\" /></div><p>Credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/endquote/157001967/in/photolist-eSFdt-eSF83-eSF29-eSEV1-eSENP-eSkrZ-eSknq-eSkhW-eSkcv-eSjJc-eSjEy-eSjzS-eSjwf-eSjq6-eSjjT-eSjeS-eSj9J-eSj2y-eSiWB-eSiQT-eSiGz-eSiAM-eSinB-eSigN-eSibn-eSi5B-eShXT-eShVh-eRNCd-eQ763-eQ73Z-eQ72E-eQ71b-eQ6Yq-eQ6X3-eQ6Vo-eQ6Ug-eQ6Ss-eQ6Rc-eQ6PT-eQ6NW-eQ6N4-eQ6Lh-ePRTF-ePRTz-ePQBS-ePQBN-ePMnx-ePMnz-ePLiY\">Josh Santangelo</a></p><p>This year, I had a really nice long walk with Kellianne, a delicious brunch, and plan a relaxing weekend of napping, drawing, house-work, and writing.</p><div class=\"image \"><img src=\"/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-me-1080x1080.jpeg\" alt=\"\" caption=\"\" srcset=\"/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-me-1080x1080.jpeg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-me-1080x1080.jpeg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-me-1080x1080.jpeg 3x\" /></div><p>Credit: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BF9hgJtuFb5JJJCjbIkTQ5ugYMUDiOHOF8oe_s0/\">Kellianne</a></p><p>And it is all good.
