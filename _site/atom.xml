   <title>44: Year of the Amateur</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2020/05/28/year-of-the-amateur"/>
   <updated>2020-05-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2020/05/28/year-of-the-amateur</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve reviewed my life around the time of my birthday every year for the last 14 years. It’s a funny habit to review a life as it’s happening. I can look back to last year when I was just acclimating to a life without a full-time tech job (with all its perks and foibles) and finishing up a book with no idea what lay on the other side of that project. Being “all in and with the flow” turned out to be a useful mindset to approach the increasingly chaotic world on the brink of cultural collapse and a global pandemic. And also a fine one to witness the contradictions of all of this as the stock market floats on a cloud of overconfidence and willful blindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I’m feeling drawn to the idea of embracing the upheaval as a portal to a new timeline. Instead of calling all the King’s horses and all the King’s men to put the world back together again, I want to look at the rubble and ask what new things can be built from these little pebbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Amateur” is my one word motto for my 44th orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to sign up for a many online courses, but rarely complete them. Dr Jason Fox’s Choose One Word online course is a delightful exception — I gobbled up every one of the videos and exercises over the course of a few weeks. He offered a whimsical tour through my favorite corners of self-reflection, character development, and meaning-making. Long story short, it was the perfect fit as an expansion pack to my yearly review, and is how I ended up arriving at “amateur” as my word for this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is an amateur?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An amateur is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“One who cultivates and participates in something but does not pursue it professionally or with an eye to gain.” – Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The label of an amateur can be used both aspirationally and in a derogatory manner. The amateur is the opposite of labels like the professional, the expert, the authority — which also have both positive and negative connotations. There are many strong cases made for the expert over the amateur. There are honesty many circumstances where I agree with the case for experts, especially when responding to a problem that is urgent and well-understood. It’s tough to argue that expertise plays a valuable role in today’s world with so many complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When is the amateur needed, then? Experts are useful when the domains of knowledge, wisdom, and craft required to thrive in a given situation are all well-understood. They are less useful when the chaotic nature of reality reveals a new chaotic shenanigan that hasn’t yet been reckoned with. Experts of other fields may swoop in, steeped in Dunning-Kruger effect, and attempt to apply their expertise in the other domain to the problem at hand. Sometimes that works, other times it makes things worse. The amateur can enter the domain with a desire to see and understand the new landscape with a beginner’s eyes, and clear a path of not-knowing so that new understanding can take seed and build up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case for the amateur can be made for anyone that looks at our current world and recognizes that a lot of the current problems have the +Chaos Monkey’s hand in it. These problems haven’t been reckoned with before, at the scale that we’re dealing with them, with the constraints that we currently have. An amateur, free from the burden of having to appear certain, is able to surf incoherence even if it means wiping out a lot in the beginning. It means actively seeking to dialogue with the Chaos Monkey rather than trying to exile them. Because that’s impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of map will this be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a map of whatever comes to mind as relevant to what is happening. It will be inconsistent, it will jump around, some parts will be way too detailed and others not nearly detailed enough. It’ll basically be a web of living Notebooks that capture whatever comes their way, linking to each other. The ability to solicit inline comments and thoughts as the scribbles are put down on paper is an interesting perk of using Dropbox Paper for something personal rather than professional. There is no thesis, no claim to working towards the truth, but hopefully some of the scrawlings will spark something in you, that then lead to something that sparks another connection for me, and we’ll get somewhere interesting together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rough notes on being an amateur
Principles / Values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Savor Mistakes. Practice letting mistakes linger instead of being immediately erased. Look at them and ask them how they can be a teacher.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indulge Distractions. Always make space and time for quiet, undirected interests to blossom. Instead of stomping down the trail of progress, keep an ear open for that unexpected bird call, and then stop and shhh to see if I can hear it again. Consider a new trail that gets you closer to the unexpected bird.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider Foolish Leads. Embark on foolish journeys. The professionals and experts have bewildered me and I sometimes can’t tell which journeys are worthwhile and which aren’t. There are probably good things hidden on trails that have been marked as too foolish to walk down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrated these into my +Values for Living.
Patterns / Behaviors
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do nothing frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Invite disagreement and conversational rabbit holes.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Draw random things for fun.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Play fun things on the piano.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Have fun reading Tarot and other symbol languages.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make imperfect meals ambitiously.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Launch impossible projects before they’re ready.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Leave some projects unfinished.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Give things away without thought.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Publish first drafts.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Allow inconsistency that feels right.
Associations&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Hobbies: Professionals have interests, skills, talents etc applied to projects and initiatives. Amateurs have hobbies that they love.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The Pages and Princesses of Tarot The youngest of the court cards, the Page (or Princess, depending on the deck) of Cups, Wands, Swords, and Coins are typically known as the enthusiastic novices of their suit. They lack the caution and the mastery that the other court carts grow to represent.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Mudskippers Long-term amateurs of life on land.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>One meaningful thing</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2020/04/07/one-meaningful-thing"/>
   <updated>2020-04-07T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2020/04/07/one-meaningful-thing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My last letter to you all was on January 16th of this year 2020. Our heads know that this was only a few months of calendar time, but our hearts know that it was a lifetime ago. The last letter was titled, What’s Next?, quaintly referring to what was next for me after all my book promotion and conversation. And now we have an answer! It’s the same as your answer. We have all converged our timelines. We have all also converged our vocabularies: exponential curves! social distancing! lockdown! community spread! contact tracing! self-quarantine! zoom happy hour! I imagine if aliens were watching us from space for the last few millennia, disorganized and frantic, how weird it must have been to see us all suddenly start moving in a more coordinated way than we likely ever have before as a species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a matter of weeks, cars started disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-1-1456x757.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-1-1456x757.jpg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-1-1456x757.jpg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-1-1456x757.jpg 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So did airplanes. And with them, pollution went down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-2-2292x1026.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-2-2292x1026.jpg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-2-2292x1026.jpg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-2-2292x1026.jpg 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People, unable to work or travel, stopped buying things as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-3-2616x676.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-3-2616x676.jpg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-3-2616x676.jpg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-3-2616x676.jpg 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(See many more impacts in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTg9n7VMzj8RqHqPImPHY3oiVjDLFHJRfYJADZh51fddM0-3FBUr_CRDPBaZ_ezUCZikmEA8GibDJYU/pub?slide=id.g72c71d2fdf_0_0&quot;&gt;this Google Slides presentation&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lukew&quot;&gt;Luke Wroblewski&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this came “out of nowhere” and yet it may also feel to some like it was destined to happen. As I wrote my letter from January 16th, referencing the Tower card in tarot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us feel like there’s an upheaval happening in the world today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I was referring to COVID-19 directly. It was way more ambiguous than that. Looking back at what the New York Times had already published the situation was presented in ways that we now know underestimated what was about to happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 10th: The coronavirus, which surfaced in the city of Wuhan, has put the region on alert, but there is no evidence that it can spread among humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 22nd: James G. Hodge Jr., director of the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University, said the shutdown [in Wuhan] would almost certainly lead to human rights violations and would be patently unconstitutional in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, here we are. Now this is happening. Now the upheaval has a name and a face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-4-1232x608.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-4-1232x608.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-4-1232x608.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/one-meaningful-thing-4-1232x608.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is in upheaval. We are in upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying it, because denial is followed by even more upheaval and death. Those natural consequences are unfortunately not necessarily only delivered for those who were denying it, but to the rest of us as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, we know on a visceral level that our individual actions have an enormous impact to ourselves and the world. Our fears have a name, and an action plan, and we can track its impact via data published continuously throughout the day. In a weird way, for better and worse, what we do matters. Our everyday routines have meaning. Yes, the conditions are not ideal nor of our choosing. We’re under enormous threat of dire consequences not only for our own actions, but of the actions of everyone else around us. And then there are the downsides caused by the safety measures themselves, that we pay even in a best case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have, collectively, entered a meaningful moment of history that is unpredictable in its unfolding (other than that it will definitely change us forever). We’ve all been recruited to play an important role in directly shifting that timeline. Where should we put our energy, attention, and weight? That’s a personal question we can each ask, with unique opportunities, costs, and constraints. The only thing we must do at some level is observe what’s happening, orient ourselves to what we see, and participate in it as it is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Between stimulus and response there is space.
In that space is our power to choose our response.
In our response lies our growth and our freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/02/18/response/&quot;&gt;Unknown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this weird time I want to use this Substack to contribute as honestly and positively as I can. So I will be shifting focus from “what’s next” for me towards “what might be helpful” to you and me. My understanding of what’s helpful is imperfect, and “my power to choose my response” is limited by my own understanding, so I’ll start small with one meaningful thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a poem I read the other day that has helped me connect with this weird moment in time, which I found linked in &lt;a href=&quot;https://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=25a34f10515c4e9393e3da856&amp;amp;id=8d7e216e75&quot;&gt;Austin Kleon’s excellent newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;things-to-do-in-the-belly-of-the-whale&quot;&gt;Things to Do in the Belly of the Whale&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Dan Albergotti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Measure the walls. Count the ribs. Notch the long days.
Look up for blue sky through the spout. Make small fires
with the broken hulls of fishing boats. Practice smoke signals.
Call old friends, and listen for echoes of distant voices.
Organize your calendar. Dream of the beach. Look each way
for the dim glow of light. Work on your reports. Review
each of your life’s ten million choices. Endure moments
of self-loathing. Find the evidence of those before you.
Destroy it. Try to be very quiet, and listen for the sound
of gears and moving water. Listen for the sound of your heart.
Be thankful that you are here, swallowed with all hope,
where you can rest and wait. Be nostalgic. Think of all
the things you did and could have done. Remember
treading water in the center of the still night sea, your toes
pointing again and again down, down into the black depths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s one meaningful thing. If we can find one, then there may be others out there. If I find another I’ll share it in another week or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my remote space to yours,&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why We Should Create Personal Mythologies (and How)</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2020/01/23/why-we-need-a-personal-mythology"/>
   <updated>2020-01-23T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2020/01/23/why-we-need-a-personal-mythology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Setting context for this post is going to be tough. It’s gonna get weird but I try to tie it all together into a useful proposal by the end. Bear with me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tossed this idea out the other day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I have a silly 2020 idea that involves creating my own personal mythology that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) passes my own bullshit test &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) connects me deeply to myself, my interests, and the world, and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) affords ways to see the world clearly, make sense of it, participate in it, and talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Buster Benson (@buster) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/buster/status/1212419523044761601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an idea that’s been developing in the back of my head, in very nebulous regions of my notes and thoughts, after a number of long-running themes have converged for me. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2QF3Vns&quot;&gt;book on productive disagreement&lt;/a&gt; is out, and the 3 years I spent researching and writing it have really crystallized for me both the urgent need for new ways to relate to one another, which require new ways of having conversations, which require new ways of thinking about the world. It seems daunting but there are many very viable paths forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to skip ahead and &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; what I’m talking about instead of all this stuff I’m writing about the process, here’s a first stab at a few fables that I’m seeding my personal mythology with: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/foolish-journey/snake-fables-book-i-201964393d6d?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=6879e563995f941bab5c737e4663a5d9&quot;&gt;Snake Fables, Book I&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, read on to learn more about &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; the “meaning crisis” is, &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s important to &lt;em&gt;revive the mythical realm&lt;/em&gt; in a way that is symbiotic with the realms of facts, personal values, and practicality. And lastly, a little bit about &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; we can go about doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What this post covers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduction: What is the Meaning Crisis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step 1: Rebuild the Mythical Realm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step 2: Plant Something Wicked&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step 3: Add Tension That Cultivates Wisdom&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step 4: Spark a Dialogue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conclusion: Take This Away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction-what-is-the-meaning-crisis&quot;&gt;Introduction: What is the Meaning Crisis?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In John Vervaeke’s amazing 50-episode YouTube series, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ&quot;&gt;Awakening from the Meaning Crisis&lt;/a&gt; (which is very long but &lt;em&gt;completely worth every minute&lt;/em&gt; if this topic is of interest to you), he articulates &lt;strong&gt;3 Perennial Problems&lt;/strong&gt; that cause us to feel like we’ve lost our grasp on the meaning of our lives. They can be succinctly described as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve lost our sense of connection to an unquestionable shared ideology.&lt;/strong&gt; Whereas throughout most of history we could rely on very specific cultural traditions, stories, a wise leaders that told us what is true, what is important, and what we should do with ourselves, for the most part those traditions have been exposed as being mistaken and in many cases harmful. There aren’t any unquestionable ideologies we can just assume we all agree on anymore. We can’t take anything for granted, and this causes us to feel like &lt;em&gt;life is absurd&lt;/em&gt;. At best, we can suspend ourselves a bit above nihilism with secular humanism, but it’s not very stable because there’s nothing unquestionable about it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve lost our sense of belonging and connection with others.&lt;/strong&gt; Our identities have fragmented, intersected, complexified, and polarized. We’re swirling around an inescapable web of cultural systems that continue to rely on tribalism and oppression to maintain cohesiveness, and we can’t figure out how to connect with each other when every one of us has both benefited from and been complicit in perpetuating the problems at hand.  The only tribes that create belonging these days seem to be those engaged in war with other tribes, and it’s tough to feel like we truly belong in any of them. Expressed as feelings of &lt;em&gt;alienation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;and loneliness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve lost our sense of connection to ourselves.&lt;/strong&gt; Without an ideology we don’t question, and a community we truly belong to, it’s tough to know who we even are. We don’t have mentors and rituals to help us find ourselves. Even as we present ourselves as personal brands, we know that there’s no true soul there. We’re stuck with questions about every belief system, feeling like an outsider to every community, and don’t even know what we want or who we truly are. This expresses itself as a &lt;em&gt;pervasive anxiety&lt;/em&gt;, and we soothe ourselves by taking up a regimen of escapes from that anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 3 perennial problems resonated with me to the core. I have been circling around them for years, calling them “universal conundrums” in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/better-humans/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=eb8e0a6f56df8083ff37d48e8ee356b3&quot;&gt;cognitive bias cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt; and eventually evolving them into the realms of the Head, Heart, and Hands in my book. These 3 realms are defined by how conversations in them are resolved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/why-we-need-a-personal-mythology-1-1000x672.png&quot; alt=&quot;Head, heart, and hands&quot; caption=&quot;Head, heart, and hands&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/why-we-need-a-personal-mythology-1-1000x672.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/why-we-need-a-personal-mythology-1-1000x672.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/why-we-need-a-personal-mythology-1-1000x672.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Head Realm.&lt;/strong&gt; The realm of information, evidence, etc that we can refer to socially as “true”. Conversations here can be resolved by looking up evidence that exists in the world somewhere. This maps to our connection with others, because we rely on communities and institutions to generate and vouch for this data that we can point to and dialogue about.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Heart Realm.&lt;/strong&gt; The realm of values, beliefs, preferences that we build within ourselves and know is true subjectively. Conversations here can be resolved with self-reflection and introspection (if the question is about our values) or by asking other people about their own beliefs, values, etc. This maps to the perennial problem of connection with ourselves, because these values in many ways are the way we connect with ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hands Realm.&lt;/strong&gt; The realm of proposals, cultural norms, predictions, and markets. Conversations here can be resolved with making a bet, running an experiment, and then waiting for the results and comparing them to our predictions. This maps to the perennial problem of connection to the unquestionable ideology, because these are the culmination of the information and values we have, and that we use to do stuff out in the world that has an impact consistent with our values and knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is very limited background that probably doesn’t do justice to the complexity and urgency of the meaning crisis if you aren’t already familiar with it so feel free to drop off here if it feels absurd. Or, watch this video with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/60936f954cc4?source=post_page-----69333b1d5e2b----------------------&quot;&gt;David Fuller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/51202ffc721d?source=post_page-----69333b1d5e2b----------------------&quot;&gt;John Vervaeke&lt;/a&gt; because they do a good job of describing it too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;    &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/yz6qgfjGMAg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal with this article is to not only propose that we consider personal mythologies as a category of responses to these problems, but to start doing it and sharing how it is going. Near the end of Vervaeke’s series he articulates the need for a “wise cultivation of enlightenment”, which is sort of what I’m hinting at, while acknowledging that that might seem ridiculous to most people. Again, if it does, you probably won’t get much out of the rest of this article, and I won’t feel bad if you close this tab right here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you’re still with me on this journey, it’s time to double down on the weirdness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-1-rebuild-the-mythical-realm&quot;&gt;Step 1: Rebuild the Mythical Realm&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, an atheist and about as anti-religion as they come, it might feel a bit dangerous to give the mythic realm another chance. The key is to be very strict about what we put in there, and to consult the realms of the head, heart, and hands as we go to make sure we’re not adding anything that isn’t compatible with our information, our values, and our practical lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not meant to be rushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve lost the language needed to talk about where, if not in the scientific head realm, they should be located in our belief systems. I think one of the reasons why this realm has become so problematic is because it began to blend with the realm of the head and heart in counterproductive ways. It needs its own space, with its own rules. Looking back to the realms of the head, heart, and hands, for example, it’s easy to see how democracy and capitalism live in the realm of the hands (they’re all about making things work together), and it’s easy to see how therapy and relationships live in the realm of the heart (they’re all about identifying deep patterns in ourselves), and it’s easy to see how the scientific method and math and physics live in the realms of the head (they’re all about replicable results and data). But where can religion live? Where can spirituality live? Where can angels, demons, heaven, hell, ghosts, muses, superstitions, horoscopes, etc live? If you put them in the realm of the head (information) they quickly fall apart due to lack of tangible evidence. If you put them into the realm of the heart (personal values), there’s no way to say that these subjective values connect to universal truths, which most of them try to claim at some point. If you put them in the realm of the hands (useful proposals), we quickly learn that they have very little predictive power and usefulness compared to other belief systems. Before the meaning crisis ate it all up, there was &lt;em&gt;another realm&lt;/em&gt; that we could all use by referring to “God’s Word” or “Divine Will” or fate or destiny or prophesy or what have you. That realm has been destroyed, bit by bit, over the last couple centuries, and it was eaten up by the other realms: the head realm invalidated its truth claims, the heart realm showed how its belief systems had the effect of reducing our agency against our values, and the hands realm pointed to other belief systems that were much more effective at building useful proposals about the world, and profiting from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lost-4th-realm&quot;&gt;The Lost 4th Realm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 4th realm of myths has been dismantled, and now we don’t have a place to put divinities, spirits, and the sacred other than into the realm of the heart as entertainment. The symbols and archetypes of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Marvel Universe, Hunger Games, and Game of Thrones are now more a part of our collective culture and language than the stories of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. Except they’re limited to being entertaining fictions instead of sacred myths. They’re designed to help us escape the anxiety of our perennial problems, not to &lt;em&gt;solve&lt;/em&gt; them by affording us the tools and space that enable us to connect ourselves to reality and create meaning. To tentatively access this scrubbed mythical realm, try to remember times when you were deeply immersed in the flow state, and everything felt meaningful and connected around a specific skill or task. Does it have lots of baggage and trauma in there? If so, it may require more scrubbing before moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since none of us likely have a mythical realm that isn’t problematic in at least a few ways, I propose that we revisit it with special suits and gloves, as you would a nuclear test zone. We need to reformat it, wipe it completely clean, twice, three times, and make sure all the yucky old toxic ideologies are really scrubbed off. Then, we can begin to ask if there’s anything at all that we can put in there that doesn’t set off our alarm bells in the other realms and re-traumatize us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This realm was embedded in our language and cultures for a long time. It’s the realm where we sometimes access that feeling of true purpose, calling, and meaning. Everything makes sense in the mythic realm, for better and worse. It’s where epic forces participate in larger-than-life battles. It has quieter forces as well — we experience these as luck, or coincidence, or synchronicity. This article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HnWN6v4wHQwmYQCLX/mythic-mode&quot;&gt;Mythic Mode&lt;/a&gt;, really made this tangible for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mythic mode is a way of &lt;strong&gt;looking at the world through a story-like lens&lt;/strong&gt;. When you enter mythic mode, you recognize that you’re a character in Omega’s story, as is everyone else. And because you’re very likely familiar with a wide range of story types, you can probably look around and see who has been given which kind of plot hook, and to what kind of tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a mode that enables personal transformation and enlightenment. It’s a mode that is all about establishing a connection with the sacred, so that we can use that to break our current frame of thinking and transcend it. It does this through story that’s not true from a factual, or subjective, or even predictive sense, but is only true as a myth of becoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you can identify a well-known story type that fits the &lt;strong&gt;transition&lt;/strong&gt; you want and also starts from a place pretty close to where you are, and you have enough slack to lean into that role, then the web might conspire to help you play out that script.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The thing is, you can’t just sit outside your role and figure out what to do. That isn’t what it feels like to live the epic story you’re examining; that’s playing the role of someone who is (among other things) analyzing the story they think they’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Instead, if you want to use this approach, you have to learn how to &lt;strong&gt;experience story from the inside&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s essentially what mythic mode is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a passage in Kim Krans’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2TjxD3d&quot;&gt;The Wild Unknown Archetypes Guidebook&lt;/a&gt; that said something similar, with different words (in case these resonate with you more):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine that as you open this deck, you are in fact discovering a pair of mystical spectacles and through their lenses you begin to view the world in a new and more vibrant way. These glasses have a knack for seeing The Unseen, unveiling the hidden, spotting the elusive, and bringing to life what has long been inanimate. For example, look at the mug that sits before you on your desk (or the one you drank from this morning). YES, INDEED, IT IS JUST A MUG. THAT’S ALL. A MUG IS A MUG! Yet, through the archetypal lens of your mystical spectacles the mug mimics one of the oldest forms of all… The Vessel! It tethers you to the innate desire of humans to hold something in, to contain a valued substance so it doesn’t leak, spill, dissipate, diminish, or disappear. We suddenly recognize that vessels and containers are everywhere… the physical body, a house, a relationship, a classroom, a state, a nation — they are all containers. Their purpose is to hold, protect, support, and distinguish one thing from the other.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Through this type of contemplation we understand why the morning routine with our warm drink is so timeless and satisfying. Sure, the mug is just a mug, yet while wearing our mystical spectacles, we know it’s more than that. We are now looking through the archetypal lens, where anything can happen. We hold The Vessel in our hands and bring it to our lips, and suddenly we are tied to an innately humbling human experience more universal than we could imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realm of myths, the archetypal lens, and mythic mode are different ways of &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; this way of connecting our reality to the universal story directly. And hopefully, by seeing it as a bridge that complements the other realms, and not as a world that replaces the other realms, we can reconnect with our meaningful role in the universe in a way that we’ve lost, and miss, without compromising our connection to truth, our values, and the practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-2-plant-something-wicked&quot;&gt;Step 2: Plant Something Wicked&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One strategy for figuring out what to put into the mythical realm is to look for real problems that we haven’t had much success addressing within the other realms. The realms of Head, Heart, and Hands are designed to resolve conversations in their own unique ways, so what kinds of problems or conversations could a mythical realm address that the others can’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here we can basically look to the meaning crisis, because it’s a list of problems that began to pile up as soon as the old 4th realm was shut down: the Perennial Problems of being connected to ourselves, to others, and to a shared mythology. The real bottom line here is that &lt;strong&gt;we have a deeply embedded need to feel connected to the meaningless universe&lt;/strong&gt;. The realms of Head, Heart, and Hands have nothing that can help us with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think of this category of problems as “wicked problems” and have &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/foolish-journey/facing-wicked-problems/home&quot;&gt;written some thoughts about it&lt;/a&gt; with a few others. I’ve tried to articulate the &lt;a href=&quot;chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/foolish-journey/hello-kevin-ac27c32146fd&quot;&gt;qualities of a wicked problem&lt;/a&gt; as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Personal, unavoidable, and existential&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Difficult, requiring lots of investment up front, and ongoing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complex and impossible to really pin down for sure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lacking in any viable solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the other realms don’t stake any claims on this kind of problem, and yet are problems that we have identified as important to address, I propose that we seed our realm of myths with all of our wicked problems that have no other home. Since this is the realm of myths, we can wrap them with mythical narrative and say that these problems are the seeds that grow into a Dark Forest. The universe, mythically-speaking, is a dark forest that defies understanding and intimidates is with its darkness and it’s sheer size and scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;    &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the Dark Forest’s voice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark Forest is filled with disquieting truths that we can’t escape and even in our tiny corner of it there are existential problems expanding like a cancer across the land. The Dark Forest is teeming with giant monsters like political polarization, environmental disasters, systemic discrimination and inequality, human rights, morality, and the problem of mortality itself. There are also smaller monsters like personal fulfillment, creative energy, mental and physical health, difficult relationships, power dynamics, personal responsibility, financial independence, and job satisfaction. Each monster requires more investment than we can afford to give, and so we fight ineffectively against them individually and as a whole. Sometimes it feels like whatever we do only causes them to come back stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a realm that responds readily to facts, values, and proposals like we’re used to. It’s a realm that requires impossible trade-offs between existential needs, personal transformation, and enlightenment to transcend our understanding and become able to see the problems from a higher perspective. All we have is a problematic forest so far — we don’t have any gods to pray to for help, or prophesies of heroes that will rescue us. In fact, the reliance on heroes and saviors and gods was part of what made the realm fall apart last time, so we need something that not only integrates with the other realms but that also makes them stronger as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we use the artifacts we’ve brought in from the other realms (what we know about how wicked problems work, the beliefs and values that are threatened by them, and the strategies that seem to work best in the real world) to better face the wicked problems of the Dark Forest with integrity and respect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not all about heroes and saviors, though they play a part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-3-add-tension-that-cultivates-wisdom&quot;&gt;Step 3: Add Tension That Cultivates Wisdom&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vervaeke talks about how the “wise cultivation of enlightenment” requires us to develop an “ecosystem of psycho-technologies” that help us address the perennial problems. They need to be more than just a list of instructions, but a suite of practices we can directly experience that actively change us as we have them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ecology of practices needs to be wrapped in a welcoming and inviting worldview that is responsive to new circumstances, new members, and new developments from the Dark Forest without giving in to the downward spiral of self-deception and fear. It has to stay open and vulnerable to the truths that come out of the Dark Forest as well as the realms of the Head, Heart, and Hands. And it also needs so stay cohesive enough to hold people together, even as it changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-updated-shared-language&quot;&gt;An Updated Shared Language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to satisfy the other realms, we should first try to address some gripes they’ve had with past mythologies. I’ll mention some here briefly in the hopes of diving into them more later on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plausibility and Relevance replace Objectivity&lt;/strong&gt;: Instead of referring to truth as objectively true or false, use a multi-step evolution of truth from being implausible to plausible, and then from being plausible to relevant/useful  within a given context. For example, for now we can say that the existence of an objective reality is &lt;em&gt;plausible&lt;/em&gt;, but not currently &lt;em&gt;relevant&lt;/em&gt; to our mythology. We shouldn’t make claims about objective reality from this realm unless we change our stance on that point. Leave what is true to the realm of the head.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inexhaustibility replaces the Infinite and Eternal&lt;/strong&gt;: Instead of relying on the infinite and eternal, use the idea of the inexhaustible (not infinite but much more abundant than we’ll ever need). For example, the Sun provides us with a reliable and practically inexhaustible source of energy, but the Sun is not an infinite source, nor is it eternal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indispensability replaces Universality&lt;/strong&gt;: Instead of relying on universal dogma that is forever fixed, use the idea of indispensability within a context. For example, the English language is indispensable to my thinking, and to my ability to communicate with others, but it’s not a universal requirement for thinking or communication.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real patterns replace Essences&lt;/strong&gt;: Instead of relying on true essences of things, in the Platonic sense, use the idea of real patterns. For example, a chair has no true essence, but is a real pattern. The difference is that a pattern is fuzzy and has no definitive threshold where it becomes or unbecomes that thing. The same thing can even be a chair to one person and a rock to another, because the pattern exists as part of the subjective landscape (heart realm) of the interpreter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with objectivity, infinity, eternity, universality, and essences is that they can all be better validated (or falsified) by the realms of the Head (information) and Hands (experiments). To the extent that those things are plausible and relevant to our myths, we can delegate the tasks of validation to those other realms instead, and avoid a whole lotta future contradictions and battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, the realm of myths will not attempt to “prove” that anything is objectively true, infinite, eternal, universal, or possessing of a true essence. The realm of myth is about how things change, and how to feel connected to a universe where everything is in flux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-do-sages-come-from&quot;&gt;Where Do Sages Come From?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the realm of this myth, everything comes from the Dark Forest, and eventually returns to it. But we can be more specific. Sages come from the seeds of specific wicked problems, the same ones that the Dark Forest grows out of, and represent our impulses to tame the Dark Forest’s chaos in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most salient and relevant wicked problem that we generally confront is chaos and death. We don’t want to return to the Dark Forest. We want to stay separate, whatever that means. So, this can be the egg that becomes our first primordial sage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sage egg is born from our unresolvable tension between being something (good) and being nothing (bad), and our unflaggable preference for the former. If we had no preference here, we wouldn’t need a sage. There’s no more universal preference in living things than the preference to be something instead of nothing, so it’s a good place to start. This tension develops into the art and science of definition, security, containment, protection, and separation from all of the opposites of those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the subconscious impulse for security and order that pushes against chaos and disorder with all its being, and by doing so, becomes conscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s capture this first impulse and call it the Snake Egg. I’ve written 4 short fables that explore this potential sage here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-4-spark-a-dialogue&quot;&gt;Step 4: Spark a Dialogue&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where it makes sense to leave our safe perch in the realm of the head, heart, and hands, and step into the realm of myth. There, we can start to tell the story from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve already discovered during my random brainstorming for this weird project of creating a personal mythology to help me confront the meaning crisis, working with the realm of myth isn’t something that you can do solo. If it were, then the realm of the heart would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myth is much more about participation, ritual, transformations, and serious play than it is about words and ideas. Also, it makes sense to be extra cautious with the realm of myth, and keep things as minimal as possible so that we don’t accidentally brainwash ourselves. So let’s review our building blocks and see what we have to play with before going any further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the realm of myths, we talked about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;3 perennial problems&lt;/strong&gt; related to how we have lost contact with the real universe, and it’s causing a crisis of sorts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;realms of the head, heart, and hands&lt;/strong&gt; are really useful places for a certain kind of conversation, but they aren’t up to the task of addressing the perennial problems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We once had a thriving &lt;strong&gt;realm of mythology&lt;/strong&gt;, but it was dismantled for parts after the previous wave of mythologies couldn’t keep up with other realms. But, we can still access it, once we delete everything in it first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the realm of myths, we have a few building blocks set up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dark Forest&lt;/strong&gt;, which grew from the seeds of all of our wicked problems that we can’t solve in the other realms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Snake Egg&lt;/strong&gt;, which was born from our own tension with the prospect of death, meaninglessness, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dialogue&lt;/strong&gt;, between Snake and Forest, can now begin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is have that dialogue and use the realm to make this tension between something and nothing, chaos and order, become real within the realm of my own personal myth. This post is just a scratch pad for the real artifacts that can be created in the realm of myths. The real work is to internalize the mythologies (sages, forest, and all) and to use that mode to better participate in the world’s problems and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is an easy ask, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m curious what others think of this so far. What are your thoughts &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jonbell&quot;&gt;Jon Bell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kev_mcg&quot;&gt;Kevin McGillivray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@vickiheart&quot;&gt;Vicki Tan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@gplewis&quot;&gt;Geoff Lewis 🎨 ✍🏻&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@aaronzlewis&quot;&gt;Aaron Z. Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@offbeatariel&quot;&gt;ArielMeadowStallings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@bjcampbell&quot;&gt;BJ Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jordangreenhall&quot;&gt;Jordan Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jonnym1ller&quot;&gt;Jonny Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@andrewjtaggart&quot;&gt;Andrew Taggart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@drjasonfox&quot;&gt;Dr Jason Fox&lt;/a&gt;, and others? Too weird? Not weird enough? Needs some salt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion-take-this-away&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Take This Away&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tldr is that we need new ways to address the perennial problems, and one of them that I see being most viable is to revive the mythic realm in a way that doesn’t challenge the strengths of the other realms. This will allow us to identify new salient possibilities (and motivations to act) via an epic story lens that are absent when we only try to address them with a scientific or economic lens, because solving these problems will never be cost-effective or practical in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t meant to be conclusive or authoritative on the meaning crisis or our response to it. Consider it a conversation piece that can be torn apart, forked and improved, played with, or ignored. The main point is to encourage participation in this conversation, because we can’t get anywhere without taking a few first stumbling steps.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://busterbenson.com/book/timeline&quot;&gt;Click here to see the timeline larger&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, things are starting to get real.&lt;/strong&gt; Today is the day I begin to share a lot more about this book on productive disagreement I spent the last 3+ years writing with the broader world. You all have been patiently hearing about it the whole time, so I want to both thank you and extend deep apologies for the next month or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just added a few things to &lt;a href=&quot;http://busterbenson.com/whyareweyelling&quot;&gt;this book website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Table of contents: 3 misconceptions and 8 things to try.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A sample of the 100 illustrations I drew for this book.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 hard questions we explore, for example: “How can I avoid being taken advantage of in bad faith conversations?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nice quotes from seriously amazing authors like Seth Godin, Annie Duke, Adam Grant, and many others. I still can’t believe these super smart people were so generous with their time to give a complete stranger like myself a boost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look and if you think of others who might enjoy the book, please share it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take to write a book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made this a while ago but it continues to be super interesting to look at as time slowly continues to pass. It’s a timeline of all the ups and downs I’ve had over the last couple years while writing this book. Each of the boxes is a week, and each of the chunks is a year:&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing a review of my life every year around my birthday since 2006. You can last year’s reflection about &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/07-02-dig-deeper&quot;&gt;digging deeper&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/me/yearly-reviews/&quot;&gt;the other 12&lt;/a&gt;.
The primary formative event of my last year was changing careers and re-entering the world of independent creator living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/43-my-40s-1948x630.png&quot; alt=&quot;My 40s&quot; caption=&quot;My 40s&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/43-my-40s-1948x630.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/43-my-40s-1948x630.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/43-my-40s-1948x630.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;large--small&quot;&gt;Large &amp;amp; small&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to see this is as a cycle I’ve now been through twice of moving from large companies to small companies. This year I oscillated back to independent creative work after 6 years at big tech companies. A brief history of my career is: I joined Amazon in 1998 and left in 2003. From 2003 to 2012 I co-founded several startups (Robot Co-op, McLeod Residence, Habit Labs). Technically Robot Co-op became part of Amazon during that time, but I left before it was re-absorbed into the mothership. From 2012 to 2019 I spent another six years at Twitter, Slack, and (briefly) Patreon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/43-2400x1887.png&quot; alt=&quot;My career&quot; caption=&quot;My career&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/43-2400x1887.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/43-2400x1887.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/43-2400x1887.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green is when I worked at these companies. The y-axis represents approximate number of employees at the company, on a logarithmic scale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here I am back on the 1-human rickshaw. Honestly, when I joined Twitter in 2012 I didn’t think I’d last more than a year or two at larger companies, but I think I underestimated how meaningful and creative the work there would be. I’m ready for another year of independent work, but at this point I see the trade-offs at both ends of the pendulum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to always rationalize why our current position is optimal, but as I get older it’s a lot easier to see how things move in cycles, and the cycles themselves are what we should pay attention to more than where we happen to be in them at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;online--offline&quot;&gt;Online &amp;amp; offline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cycle that’s present here is the cycle between tech and traditional businesses. I was a creative writing major in college, and dreamed of writing novels but then joined the tech world because it was such an exciting time. McLeod Residence was an art gallery and bar in Seattle that was my first attempt to return to the brick and mortar tangible world. That was hard so I ended up going back to tech for a while, and am now trying another route that hearkens back to my original writing aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s something in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Monday morning I woke up without a client project for the first time in ten years. For most of my career, my goal was to build my client list. And that work paid off. Over the course of 11 years I’ve worked with over 80 clients. For most of the last decade, I loved client work. I loved the challenge of art direction, feedback and the back and forth toward something final. I loved working with art directors, who are mostly incredibly smart, hard working, kind people. I even grew to love a tight deadline. I feel so lucky that I got to work on so many incredible projects. But in the past few years I started to feel really tired and simultaneously disconnected from my own creativity. I have always made my own work amidst doing client work, so that wasn’t exactly the problem. I just wasn’t doing it with enough depth or any sense of abandon anymore because I didn’t have the time or energy. And I felt increasingly sad about that disconnect. Earlier this year I realized I needed — at least temporarily — to turn my attention back to my own process &amp;amp; work, not just a little, but in full force. So with the exception of some book projects, I made a choice to stop making art for other people for awhile. This was not an easy decision. Client work is a huge part of my income. The relationships I have with some of my clients feel almost like family. Much of my own sense of success has been in direct relationship to the relative demand for my work, which has luckily been high. So if I stopped doing the thing I worked so hard at building over 10 years, who would I be? I started grappling with that question earlier this year. And I realized that my happiness, my connection to my well of creativity, was more important than my identity as a busy commercial illustrator. So I finished up the assignments I had before my vacation &amp;amp; have stopped taking on new client projects. This summer &amp;amp; fall I’m working on a couple books with generous timelines. I’ll continue to run my shops, teach &amp;amp; speak . But I’m entering a new phase with enough space for exploration. And while I’m scared AF, I’m also ALL IN. Shaking things up feels good. ❤️&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/lisacongdon/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Lisa Congdon&lt;/a&gt; (@lisacongdon) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2019-05-31T14:13:38+00:00&quot;&gt;May 31, 2019 at 7:13am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase “all in” is really interesting to me, because it’s both exactly how I feel and also the opposite of how I feel. And this distinction is what fascinates me. How is it possible to go in “full force” while doing it “at least temporarily” and not trigger a paradox that destroys the universe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-years-motto-all-in--with-the-flow&quot;&gt;This year’s motto: All in &amp;amp; with the flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be all in is to commit whole-heartedly to something. To go with the flow is to let the flow carry you where it may. To combine the two means to go all in with full force while it makes sense, and then to go all in with full force on the next thing that makes sense. And in order to do this there can’t be a lot of top-down structure in place limiting where force can be directed, or limiting where it can be redirected to. Maybe that’s creative freedom, and why it is tough to operationalize it in large structured groups like organizations, and why creative people need to exist in a loosely-connected interdependent sense with lots of people rather than participate in a rigid hierarchy optimized for efficiency and productivity at a specific task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toolkit&quot;&gt;Toolkit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tool kit for being all in &amp;amp; with the flow is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://busterbenson.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Blog about non-professional things more&lt;/a&gt; (and write more &lt;a href=&quot;https://buster.substack.com/&quot;&gt;newsletters&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://busterbenson.com/beliefs/&quot;&gt;Keep my beliefs up-to-date&lt;/a&gt; (be proactive rather than reactive)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://busterbenson.com/the-life-of/buster/&quot;&gt;Focus health-improvement on making it to my 100th birthday&lt;/a&gt; (a recent hypertension diagnosis is all the motivation I need)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/bustrbensn/&quot;&gt;Draw more&lt;/a&gt; (and don’t compare myself to other artists)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t be afraid of selling things (I’m still afraid of selling things)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build things that last (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://750words.com/&quot;&gt;750 Words&lt;/a&gt; that turns 10 this year)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep dialogues open (I wrote a book about it, after all)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach out to people (independence requires interdependence)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I get this question a lot, I’ll answer it pre-emptively. “What can I do to be less biased?” My answer, after thinking about this for many years, is that the best we can do is to reduce the time and energy we expend trying to defend our biases and blind spots when they’re challenged. I call it developing honest bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some tips on how to use this app to develop honest bias:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-focus-on-the-strategies-more-than-the-biases&quot;&gt;1. Focus on the strategies more than the biases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to remember all 200 biases, because you can look them up here any time if one’s on the tip of your tongue. Instead, it might be easier to remember the 13 strategies. They represent the shortcuts we take in order to make decisions and take actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-consider-what-causes-the-anxiety-that-leads-to-bias&quot;&gt;2. Consider what causes the anxiety that leads to bias&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;🧠 &lt;strong&gt;Information in your head:&lt;/strong&gt; there’s too much information in the universe to process, so we filter most of it out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;❤️ &lt;strong&gt;Beliefs in your heart:&lt;/strong&gt; everything is confusing until we make sense of it by telling a story. This is where we get our meaning from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;🖐 &lt;strong&gt;Plans in your hands:&lt;/strong&gt; time is short and we have to get things done, so we jump to conclusions and take actions with what we have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-notice-bias-in-our-brains-and-in-everything-else-around-us&quot;&gt;3. Notice bias in our brains and in everything else around us&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These biases existed first in our brains, but you can also find them in the technology we use, in the institutions we’ve built, and the cultural norms we practice. They’re everywhere. The best we can do is develop “honest bias”. I think of this as a dedication to remaining open to our own limitations, listening to evidence that contradicts our beliefs, inviting diverse perspectives to the table, and being willing to be uncomfortable with the fact that the universe is big, we are small, and there’s no ultimate solution to any of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app is really just a starting point for understanding how you can find better ways to think, communicate, and act that are in line with your intentions. Hope you find it useful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pocketbiases&quot;&gt;started a new Twitter account (@pocketbiases)&lt;/a&gt; that will tweet out a bias-a-day for the next 200ish days. It’s another way to keep all this fresh in our minds so we can remember to notice them in our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>History of my name</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/02/06/history-of-my-name"/>
   <updated>2019-02-06T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/02/06/history-of-my-name</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a pretty weird story to share about my name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born with the name Erik Keith Benson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents told me that &lt;strong&gt;Erik&lt;/strong&gt; is a Norse/Swedish name meaning king or something, loosely hand-waving to my father’s side of the family that is from there (though we have no known family that’s still over there). My mom said that the “k” was also convenient because it maps to the hard “k” sounds in Japanese. My first name in Hiragana is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h1 id=&quot;えりっく&quot;&gt;えりっく&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And is pronounced eh-ri–ku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith&lt;/strong&gt; was my father’s middle name and my grandfather’s middle name, and my grandfather went by Keith. Another call out to that side of the family, but I don’t know if it had any significance past that. Looking it up on family search, none of my grandfather’s other 12 (!) siblings had the middle name Keith, and I don’t see it showing up in generations previous to that either. I remember some kid making fun of my middle name when I was super young… he said it was a nerdy or otherwise awkward name, and I often made fun of my own middle name for years, probably as a self-defense mechanism to that. It’s weird how that is still attached to my relationship with that name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;Benson&lt;/strong&gt; also comes from my father’s side. I wish I had some connection to my mom in my name… that K at the end of Erik isn’t really a whole lot to go on. Benson was given to Sven “Swanty” Johan Bengtsson when he immigrated to the US on September 27th, 1875, having been converted by Mormon missionaries (I think).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the fun part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006 I was feeling a little crazy and one night drunkenly decided to change my name for a year. As a vacation from my identity. I was feeling a bit stagnant, I guess, and needed to shake things up. So I asked a bunch of people to help me choose a new name to use for a year, and also tried to recruit friends to do it with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fun to ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What would it be like to be John for a year? Or a Timothy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was part of a startup that helped build goals called 43things.com at the time (it’s gone now), and I posted this question to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What’s the point of changing my name? Well, now that the goal’s on my list, the point is to cross it off my list. Everything on your list has a point – that’s the magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on September 6th, 2006 I drove to city hall with a polar bear (someone I had met at a show who also wanted to change her name, but who always wore a polar bear costume and went by the name Vladmir the Polar Bear) and flipped a coin in the courtroom to choose between the two final contestants for my last name: Butterfield and McLeod. It landed on &lt;strong&gt;McLeod&lt;/strong&gt;, so I made Butterfield my middle name, and also changed my first name to Buster which had come to me in a dream. In the dream I had opened a cafe called Buster’s Cafe, and that seemed as legit a reason to use that name as any other I would ever come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few questions from the judge, who found the whole endeavor rather silly, my legal name became &lt;strong&gt;Buster Butterfield McLeod&lt;/strong&gt;. And a few months later another friend who also changed her last name to McLeod started a bar and art gallery in Seattle named McLeod Residence. That’s a whole separate story, but when I got married to Kellianne a few years later neither of us wanted to use our current last names for various reasons and we decided to to back to Benson. And I changed my middle name back to Keith, but kept the first name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name I have today, &lt;strong&gt;Buster Keith Benson&lt;/strong&gt;, is partially from my parents and partially from a dream. There’s a whole lot more to this story as well, but it’s best told over a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The definition of “emotional labor” has changed</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/01/20/the-definition-of-emotional-labor-has-changed"/>
   <updated>2019-01-20T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/01/20/the-definition-of-emotional-labor-has-changed</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Arlie Hochschild coined the term in her book, The Managed Heart, to describe a component of some service industry jobs in which workers must project a different emotion than the one they are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new common usage is super valuable for us, and probably more valuable than the original intended meaning. But I also really like the original intended meaning and think it too is a phenomenon worth understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The new usage of “emotional labor” has gained currency as a way to describe the myriad unpaid jobs and responsibilities that people (many of them women) take on in families, offices, and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In families, the term refers to the mental work required to keep a household running—all that scheduling and bill-paying and research—as well as the anxiety of being in charge of those thankless and largely invisibly tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Emotional labor” had a narrower meaning as it was originally conceived. In 1983, the Berkeley sociologist Arlie Hochschild coined the term in her book, The Managed Heart, to describe a component of some service industry jobs in which workers must project a different emotion than the one they are experiencing. The most often used example of this is a flight attendant tasked with maintaining an air of friendly calm, even amidst passenger complaints or turbulence (a notion that inspired an entire genre of Saturday Night Live skits). It’s a useful term, to describe a real phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original definition of “emotional labor” is the work of separating your public expression of emotions from your private experience of emotions. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When academic terms escape into the wilderness and take on new meaning, the concepts and arguments they describe meet a broader audience. Solomon points to the idea of “intersectionality” as another modern example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But now, “intersectional” is often used in a positive sense as in: an intersectional approach to activism, or an intersectional outlook. It’s used to describe people working to be aware of the ways different identities overlap and intersect; and it has become shorthand for thinking outside your own experience of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usage of “intersectionality” has evolved to include positive aspects as well as oppressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She pointed out that the most powerful, compelling terms and concepts hit upon something that needed a name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>The Hippocratic Oath</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/01/17/hippocratic-oath"/>
   <updated>2019-01-17T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/01/17/hippocratic-oath</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went down a strange research rabbit hole about the Hippocratic Oath, and tweeted about it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The first interesting thing I learned about the Hippocratic Oath is that the words &amp;quot;Primum non nocere&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;First, do no harm&amp;quot; don&amp;#39;t appear in the original. It has a more wishy-washy line about not harming people, but it&amp;#39;s not central or primary to the oath.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Buster (@buster) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/buster/status/1086040872649519104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 17, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click through for the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a modern re-write of the Hippocratic Oath which is the version most adopted by doctors today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, it’s good to be humble and acknowledge the mountain of science that every doctor stands upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures that are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite line in the oath because it acknowledges that it’s necessary to always find the right balance here, and there’s no hard line around treatment or no treatment that a medical philosophy can rest on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon’s knife or the chemist’s drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another caveat to our instincts to reduce everything to facts and theories. You gotta be a human as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will not be ashamed to say “I know not,” nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More humility. More acceptance of the fact that we’re all human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to think that there’s a big problem with a lack of humility in the medical profession. But this is a good reminder. Doctors don’t know everything. Nor can they save everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person’s family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, patients are humans too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not as easy to take credit for. So another reminder to do things that get the outcome but avoid the credit, because they can be more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, still a human!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy life and leave the world better than you found it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Can a friendly and diverse dialogue exist between liberals and conservatives on the internet?</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/01/09/friendly-and-diverse-community"/>
   <updated>2019-01-09T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/01/09/friendly-and-diverse-community</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last 2+ years I’ve been researching and writing a book about productive disagreement (&lt;em&gt;Why Are We Yelling?&lt;/em&gt; will be published in 2020). It’s based on work that has unfolded since I synthesized all 200+ cognitive biases into 4 universal conundrums that our brains are constantly trying to solve in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.medium.com/vt53kCLjlT&quot;&gt;Cognitive Bias Cheat Sheet&lt;/a&gt;, which has since been read more than a million times. This unfolding project has been the hardest and most rewarding work of my professional life so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems necessary to put these ideas into practice towards something meaningful. That is, addressing one space that is very negatively impacted by our struggles with communication: politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in the early stages of forming what hopes to be a &lt;strong&gt;friendly&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;diverse&lt;/strong&gt; community for political conversation online. You probably think I should have my head checked, right? I know many efforts are happening around this right now because the time is ripe for this to happen. I think we can do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s invite-only and will be moderated to encourage respectful, open dialogue from all sides. The only problem is that my own network is largely liberal-leaning. Like many these days, I live in a bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best way to make it all feel less like a trap to conservatives and more like an opportunity to relieve some of our collectively built up frustration is to find a founding member with strong ties in conservative communities. I’m extremely interested in any intros to people you think might be a good fit for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-fruitful&quot;&gt;What is Fruitful?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It will be a Q&amp;amp;A site with representation from every political and policy perspective we can find. There will be areas to “Ask a liberal person with who is pro-immigration” and “Ask a person who didn’t vote in 2016” and “Ask a person who believes Trump is doing positive things for our country” etc. It will focus on people more than groups because part of the problem is that you can’t understand a group, or talk to it… you can only talk to and understand individuals. There will be a code of conduct for how to ask questions and how to answer them, geared towards open-ended questions and generous listening. Our first chat will be “Ask a liberal Episcopal pastor” and we’ll try to do one every week. Every member will have a chance to express their worldview and invite curious and friendly inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We aren’t trying to change anyone’s mind. We’re trying to expand our perspectives to include how other people see things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Imagine if we had a respectful, quiet, and friendly place on the internet to ask honest questions of people we don’t normally relate to. Wouldn’t that alone make the next two years a bit more bearable?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It will also be free. This won’t be ad-supported or sponsored in any way, it’s all coming out of my pocket because I see this as an existential need for so many of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the pitch, feel free to send it to people or modify it to fit your style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still super early, but here’s a sample of the topics we’re beginning to explore…
This project will only work if we can show that quiet, respectful voices do have space and power to be vulnerable and to bring out the best in each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve lost all hope that we’ll ever resolve these problems, I beg you to give this a chance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-wants-to-help&quot;&gt;Who wants to help?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m open to all ideas that increase the possibility of this working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until we get the balance closer to even I’ve reduced invites to people who tend towards liberal politics, but that will change again once we’ve got more balanced representation. I want there to be enough people from different perspectives to cancel out any power imbalances in the community because that’s a prerequisite for the kind of trust and investment of time and energy that I hope everyone will put in together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be inviting people in batches over the coming weeks…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;save-a-spot-on-the-wait-list&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eepurl.com/gdcKeH&quot;&gt;Save a spot on the wait list!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

   <title>Announcing a new friendly and diverse community: Fruitful</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/01/07/fruitful"/>
   <updated>2019-01-07T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/01/07/fruitful</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-it&quot;&gt;What is it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fruitful will be an invite-only Q&amp;amp;A community around the question of how we can be most productive as humans and citizens during the upcoming 2020 election season (based on many streams of work I’ve been aggregating for my book on productive disagreement). It won’t be on Facebook, and it won’t be ad-supported, and it will be FREEEEE. It’ll be a place to ask questions and get input from a wide variety of perspectives that are quieter and more nuanced than the kind that travel through the news and social streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest goal I have is to make it a FRIENDLY AND DIVERSE community, with people from many different perspectives and backgrounds communicating productively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not going to happen by accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this right, I’m gonna need your help. This means, from the start, we need to find people who aren’t in my filter bubble politically and demographically, and to work with them from the start as founding members who can help represent views that I can’t represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means finding women, under-represented minorities, a variety of ages, ethnicities, and economic and social circumstances. It also means finding people who are on the right, and people who have lost hope, and people who are not represented by any political party. If you are in one of these groups, please reach out! I want to work with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It does NOT mean I’m looking for ass hats and harassers. In fact, ass hats and harassers aren’t allowed no matter what your political persuasion is.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The super tricky challenge is that we’re all going to have to leave our bad faith at the door, and separate our desire for change from our desire to hurt people who resist change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of war zones on the internet if your goal is to merely attack others rather than seek to understand and open dialogues with people. There is a time and place for that too, but it’s not the need I’m trying to serve here. Opening a dialogue doesn’t mean validating them and it doesn’t require you to shirk your duty to your side’s agenda. This is a separate mission, but aligned to the same end goal of doing whatever it takes to improve our current political and life situation, for everyone. The government is currently closed, if you need any proof that what we’re doing is only entrenching political divisions even more, and hurting people for bad reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>30 fundamentals</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/01/04/30-fundamentals"/>
   <updated>2019-01-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/01/04/30-fundamentals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-top-take-away&quot;&gt;My top take-away&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lifted a couple things from this list and added them to my own beliefs file. Specifically, thoughts around how modern life is changing the way we relate and communicated to each other and causing all kinds of problems. Overall, this is a great read and also a great example of the value in articulating foundational beliefs and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-highlights&quot;&gt;My &lt;mark&gt;highlights&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The kind of background assumptions that float by unnoticed when you agree with them work very differently when you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love how this is articulated. Our confirmation bias against our cognitive dissonance… two sides of the same coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s interesting how so many things are implied and unsaid (and how, if you agree with these things, you don’t even notice). A writer may leave things unspecified for several reasons: they might not be aware of their own assumptions, they might think they are obvious, or they might just think the reader agrees. Or all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, and also the impracticality of actually being explicit about everything. Communication is already so difficult and low-bandwidth that we have to take advantage of unsaid things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This works ok in the real world. It doesn’t work at all on the internet where voices are disembodied and spaces have ill-defined borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because in the real world we tend to have more history with the people we’re talking to. Not necessarily because of the medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It also encourages a shoot-first-ask-questions-later, “thorns out” approach to reading about contentious issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like “thorns out”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would be helpful if people writing online could point to some description of their fundamental beliefs, interests and assumptions, so you could get a better picture of who they are and where their writing is coming from [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But be warned, enumerating your own unstated basic beliefs was much harder than I thought it’d be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very true. We find that we have only glimmers of our own beliefs, and have to make them up more than discover them when we try to look for what they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That we have a particular kind of territory doesn’t mean we have to have a particular kind of map. There are many valid maps of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;some maps clearly hug the territory tighter than others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great sentiment. I am just a big fan of the map/territory metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thus, the structure and adoption of narratives shapes our collective worldviews and our societies, all the way up the chain from single words to full-blown paradigms. The struggle for the rights to shape them resembles war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narrative shapes as distinct from facts. That sounds right to me. And the desire to protect and change our precious narrative shapes resonates as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the constant reshaping of our shared conceptual world by the process of discourse is a more important arena for rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100% agree!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Models, rules, and patterns have exceptions. That does not invalidate them. Outside of hard science, it’s rarely a good idea to make models and concepts much more complicated to chase a few outliers and edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find myself strongly disagreeing with this one. It seems too specific of a strategy to apply to all models, rules, and patterns. It was just said that the struggle to shape narratives can resemble war…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Intelligence tests measure something real, and it is significantly heritable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lots of anxiety around this comment, as it’s very easy to misinterpret or magnify harmful stereotypes. That said, my only really caveat to it is that we should decouple what is real from what is fixed vs what is in constant flux. A snapshot of something real from a certain perspective captures a moment in time that may or may not change in quality and measurement in the future or since the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;while there is a human nature, it manifests in different ways and is only observable as a highly garbled signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, this is likely the same point I was trying to make in the comment on #11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In practice, there are, when assigning responsibility for life outcomes, two poles: one being a high-agency stance that treats individual freedom and responsbility as absolute, and the other a low-agency stance that treats choices as constrained so much by social structures that responsibility is best placed on the system as a whole[6][7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to nab this exact wording and add it to my beliefs file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Way more social and political problems, dissatisfactions, internal dissonances etc. than we think stem from us living in very large (as opposed to small sub-dunbarian) societies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone arguing has a point, even if often not a very strong one. Charity and civility in disagreement is an essential virtue, and make an effort to understand under what conditions something seemingly wrong would make sense. People are more different in how they see the world than we think, and we should practice telling ourselves stories that make the other sympathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great one to end on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;read-it&quot;&gt;Read it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get a coffee and take 20-30 minutes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://everythingstudies.com/2018/07/16/30-fundamentals/&quot;&gt;read it&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you don’t agree with everything, or understand each point (I got lost on a few) it’s a good brain-stretcher.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Equilibriums and Limits: a better way to look at most every political issue</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/01/02/equilibriums-and-limits"/>
   <updated>2019-01-02T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2019/01/02/equilibriums-and-limits</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-top-take-away&quot;&gt;My top take-away:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the argument is about a binary choice between only two option, consider re-framing the difference as something that exists along a spectrum, with more than two possible perspectives. Some perspectives will be about which direction we should push, relative to our current circumstances (aka &lt;strong&gt;equilibrium perspectives&lt;/strong&gt;). Others will be about what kinds of absolute limits we should put into place regardless of current circumstances (aka &lt;strong&gt;limitation perspectives&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-highlights&quot;&gt;My &lt;mark&gt;highlights&lt;/mark&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We sometimes think of political issues in binary terms. Is someone pro-life or pro-choice? But most individuals hold views that are more complicated than a binary can capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fool’s choice. If you’re choosing between one thing or the other, expand the pool of considered options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An alternative is to describe a given position on a spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesssss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most political stances can be understood in terms of an equilibrium. For instance, some people might believe that access to abortion in a conservative state is too restricted under the status quo, and favor relaxing the rules regulating abortion clinics. That is, they might favor shifting the equilibrium in a “pro-choice” direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stance is relative to the current perceived status quo rather than an absolute position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some Americans would feel less polarized and alienated from their fellow citizens if they recognized that some of the people fighting on “the other side” of a polarizing issue actually hold values and beliefs that are strikingly similar to their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A way to find common ground is to identify whether your position is about movement relative to status quo, or about an absolute limit at one end or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The campus left wants the free-speech debate to be focused on limits. What if an invited speaker is a neo-Nazi or wants to say the N-word or deny the Holocaust? In contrast, the campus right fares better when the debate is focused around the equilibrium. Across partisan and racial divides, large majorities agree that colleges are not doing enough to teach young Americans about the value of free speech and not doing enough to ensure students are exposed to a variety of viewpoints. In surveys, they express antagonism toward threats of violence and racial slurs even while insisting that, on the whole, campuses should be less politically correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this case, as in others, the “equilibrium majority” is reluctant to make concessions to the “limit majority” because they are concerned about slippery slopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slippery slope fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>History of my beliefs (so far)</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2018/12/31/history-of-my-beliefs"/>
   <updated>2018-12-31T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2018/12/31/history-of-my-beliefs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A short history of how my &lt;mark&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/beliefs&quot;&gt;beliefs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/mark&gt; have moved over the years. You can find every change to every belief between 2012 and 2019 in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/commits/master&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2012.md&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listed about 40 beliefs the first time I sat down and tried to do this. Organized by subject, like “On Morality”, “On Science &amp;amp; the Universe”, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2013&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2013.md&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It almost doubled in length in the second year to about 70 beliefs. It was still largely tracked on a subject basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2014&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2014.md&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added a bunch of stuff to the top and all around the beliefs to better explain the system of tracking beliefs over time and reviewing them frequently. I think I realized at this time just how valuable the project was to my own sense of well-being, and I hoped others would find it useful too. I also added a section for my “favorite ideas” because these too seemed to shift and grow over time in a way that was useful to occasionally review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2015&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2015.md&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried something new this year, and attempted to organize by beliefs by the type of belief they were instead of by their subject. I was really interested in understanding the structure of beliefs, and coming up with language to describe how beliefs were shaped in our brains, and how they served different functions. I think this is where I lost a lot of people… whereas before people would see the Codex and say “Wow, I want to make one” now they said “Wwow, that looks complicated. I could never do something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2016&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2016.md&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stuck with this system for another year, cleaning it up, trying to explain it better and make it feel less intimidating. I continued to add new beliefs and change old ones as well, with the count growing to around 115. But my interests had shifted a bit to cognitive which were one level deeper than beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2017&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2017.md&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More shuffling, more cleaning up. But I think I saw the writing on the wall this year and realized that this new structure wasn’t going to hold where this needed to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2018&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs.md&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refactored everything to come back to be organized by subject, but kept a bit of structure to separate beliefs that were about how I saw the world, and beliefs about how I thought the would should be. The first set includes beliefs that could potentially be proven wrong with new information, but the second set was more a matter of opinion. This turned out to be really useful in my continued exploration of biases and arguments, because this small difference in the belief makes a bit difference in how you form them, and how you talk about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2019&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starts tomorrow, &lt;a href=&quot;/beliefs&quot;&gt;in a new place&lt;/a&gt; (aka here). The subject categories have been cleaned up a bit more, and I’ve shifted to using tags (marked by emoji) to show how some beliefs are about information (🧠 the head), values (❤️ the heart), and strategy (✋ the hand). And I also added a 🔥 tag to any that are particularly sensitive to me, and an indicator for how confident I am in the belief (💪 or 🤞).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll see where it takes us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image used in this post is the motto of “The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge”. The phrase “nullius in verba” is Latin for “Take nobody’s word for it.” It’s probably the best way to describe the power of tracking beliefs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually do these on my birthday at the end of May, but it’s now July. Whoops. Most (okay, all) of my energy is going into 3 things right now and for the foreseeable future: family, work (Patreon), book. Book, by virtue of being the most flexible, is taking the 3rd rank there, and is therefore the most behind. Meaning that, given time to think and write, which this post generally requires, there’s usually a higher urgency need to work on the book directly. Hence the delay. That’s my story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I know that self-reflection of the past and coming year is fundamental to actually being a productive and healthy contributor to family, work, and the book… so here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One notable thing about all of this is that my 3 priorities are converging more than they ever have in the past. I’m looking back at the mottos from last few years: cultivate quality time (38), make wiggle room (39), mind the loops (40), and seek endarkenment (40)… these are all links in the same chain that now turns out to be a universal mindset that applies to family, work, and writing. I guess that’s a convenient byproduct of systems thinking… eventually it all has to fit together into a single puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be more specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It probably goes back further. My multi-decade long love of private journaling, constraints, unfiltered streams of consciousness, quantified self, and self-reflection are all links in the chain too. I remember journaling in college, and then writing in LiveJournal, and then doing morning pages, 8:36pm, and most recently doing my “&lt;a href=&quot;https://writtenonbart.com/&quot;&gt;Written on Bart&lt;/a&gt;” series, slowly circling around a hunch that somewhere below my thoughts was an invisible, interconnected web of ideas and meaning that were more interesting than the things that happened to bubble up to the surface of my mind and personal narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing 50 posts in between the time BART’s subway doors closed at either Ashby or El Cerrito Plaza station, and when they opened in SF on Civic Center or Powell, was like taking a shovel and digging deeper and deeper into the unprocessed portions of my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My coworker, Ben, and I were designing a 1-hour discussion for our product/eng/design offsite a few months back. As we were brainstorming, he told the story of a teacher (if my memory serves me) who gave the class, or maybe just him, advice to “Dig deeper” on a particular topic or assignment. It has rung in my ears since… dig deeper! The problems and answers are not out in the world, they’re inside us. Since Trump was elected, I’ve been struggling with how to respond, how to even interpret what is happening in the first place… but as tempting as it has been to blame him and Nazis and evil-doers for the world’s problems, I keep returning to a mistake that I made… I had been overly optimistic about the direction of the world (I had even bet a friend that we would win the presidency as well as a majority in the Senate and the House)… how embarrassingly wrong I was. My optimism creates a blind spot around how the world actually was. And now the blind spot has grabbed the spotlight. Now, I grieve for my inaccurate assessment of the country and the world… it was never right, and by being inaccurate it allowed problems to fester. Cultural debt leads to culture wars. I had not dug deep enough to realize this at the time. Going forward, perhaps I could do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niko helps me dig deeper too. Seeing the world through a child’s eyes, where nothing makes sense yet, but giant open questions are opened and resolved on an almost daily basis made me realize how many ideas and mental models we have that are unexamined simply because there’s consensus on them. Because an authority figure (in this case me) gave a confident answer. As I learned to dig deeper, maybe I could help him build those skills early, so that not every confident authority figure he runs into can just insert answers into his brain without examination. How might that even work? I would have to dig deeper to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I could write a systems thinking children’s book? Incidentally, my first proposal to the editor and agent I am now working with was a “Little Prince meets Star Trek meets Who Moved My Cheese” space fable. It had the bonus quality of being the first idea that felt like it might unite family and writing priorities. 20 first chapters and book proposals later, I got a deal that seemed too good to be true! It’s no longer a space fable but it still unites family, and writing, and work too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But work (at Twitter, then Slack) remained unintegrated from the other direction, like the stubborn force of gravity that refuses to link up with the Grand Theory of Everything. How might work add value to writing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later, Patreon floats past my view and I realize that’s the solution! Working with creators: podcasters, YouTubers, webcomic artists, illustrators, writers, and all manner of niche creative types who are also trying to unify their lives under a single Grand Theory! Gravity, however, remains unintegrated as far as I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, this last year, I signed a book deal with Portfolio (an imprint of Penguin Random House) to &lt;a href=&quot;http://patreon.com/buster&quot;&gt;write a book about arguing&lt;/a&gt;. Why arguing? Well, arguing is something that applies to every field of interest, and also pretty much every moment of every day. Family, work, craft, and self. To argue is to be human. Arguing is generally not considered to be quality time, except that sometimes, as if by freak accident, it creates the best quality time… conflict brings resolution. The heat of argument is not so different from the passion to live meaningfully. We argue because we care! Arguing makes us wiggle, and gets us nervous, and yet arguments are also sign posts for interesting conversations that we really should be having. Even if they aren’t the conversations we want to have. To be frank, we want to change other people, prove their idiocy wrong, shame their maliciousness, and silence their unproductive dissent. We’re motivated to confirm our own positions, and to ignore any evidence to the contrary. We surround ourselves with people who feel the same. We use zingers to keep our spirits up and taunt the enemy, and to get a laugh while stinging our enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That unproductive kind of arguing, and digging deeper, could not be more different in spirit and execution. But how to flip it to something productive? This has been my obsession this last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;last-years-motto-seek-endarkenment&quot;&gt;Last year’s motto: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@buster/41-seek-endarkenment-9700663dea67&quot;&gt;seek endarkenment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endarkenment is the opposite of enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If enlightenment is getting the answer, endarkenment is walking into the uncertainty of an open question. A dark room. If enlightenment is having all the evidence and data to prove that you’re right, endarkenment is the doubt of not knowing if you are right or if you just fear that you aren’t right and so are signaling confidence to brute force your way out of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If enlightenment is the Obama presidency, endarkenment is the Trump presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If enlightenment is getting degrees, making money, setting up a matched 401K, angel investing, and getting invited to all the cool parties, endarkenment is wondering if you should opt out of the entire scene and move to a small island, and live with monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enlightenment is fighting for truth. Endarkenment is wondering if you’re even on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can get a bit dark. It’s endarkenment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;motto-for-my-42nd-year-dig-deeper&quot;&gt;Motto for my 42nd year: dig deeper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of my now 4-year interest into systems thinking, quality time, and cognitive biases. Jack posed a question on Twitter recently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What are the best books you’ve read on critical thinking? And why? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/iRMx0qGaGw&quot;&gt;https://t.co/iRMx0qGaGw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; jack (@jack) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1012801112934502403?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 29, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of solid answers in the replies. Critical thinking and cognitive biases are my jam. Not because I’m any better at it than others, but maybe a little bit because I know how bad I am at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a million people have now “read” my post that claims to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18&quot;&gt;cognitive bias cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been translated a bunch and used in classes, papers, and books all over the world. It’s weird, given that I just summarized a Wikipedia page. But it’s also not weird. The accidental secret to its success is that it takes advantage of all 4 bias categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are several hundred cognitive biases (too many), so reducing them to 4 basic problems helps filter out the noise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s no satisfying theory that unites all biases (not enough meaning), so I made one up that wasn’t “because brains suck” but a bit more friendly and forgiving “our brains are doing their darn best”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nobody actually has time to devote to immersing themselves in the nuances of biases, so now you can just bookmark this cheat sheet and share it with friends. Done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our attention and memories are like a school of baby penguins gripping a slippery sheet of ice in a category-5 hurricane. Even a bookmark is too hard to keep track of. Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/thinking-is-hard/4-conundrums-of-intelligence-2ab78d90740f&quot;&gt;phone lock screen&lt;/a&gt; to hold onto as the waves of distractions constantly crash onto you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking for critical thinking tips on Twitter is a bit like having 24-hours left to live and spending it searching for a 1-day course on how to spend the last day of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s okay though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean to pick on Jack, because we all do this. That’s the point! We’re all part of a wiggling universe that is extremely worried that it’s not good enough. We spend our last days on Earth looking for ways to signal to ourselves and others that we’ve at least put in sufficient time worrying about this problem. The hope being that we’ll then feel good enough, and give ourselves permission to do other more pleasant things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I say I want to dig deeper, it’s not to reach enlightenment. It’s to reach endarkenment, where I can appreciate being part of a universe that doesn’t think in terms of good enough or not, because obviously we all are. Instead I want to dig deeper in terms of appreciating the world as it is, grieving the loss of wishful thinking about how we wanted the world to be, and enthusiastically participating in the tiny patch that we find ourselves in, while we last. Maybe on a small island with monkeys. Maybe we’re already there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love these monkeys. Some who can’t keep their pants up while bouncing on beds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/family-photo-louie-pants-1600x1066.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/family-photo-louie-pants-1600x1066.jpeg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/family-photo-louie-pants-1600x1066.jpeg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/family-photo-louie-pants-1600x1066.jpeg 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some who are quickly developing their own complex inner narratives of life on monkey island:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/family-photo-buster-niko-1600x1066.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/family-photo-buster-niko-1600x1066.jpeg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/family-photo-buster-niko-1600x1066.jpeg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/family-photo-buster-niko-1600x1066.jpeg 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course this lovely monkey I have enlisted to enthusiastically participate with most closely, approaching 10 years now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/family-photo-buster-kellianne-1600x1066.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/family-photo-buster-kellianne-1600x1066.jpeg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/family-photo-buster-kellianne-1600x1066.jpeg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/family-photo-buster-kellianne-1600x1066.jpeg 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family, work, book. These are the shadows cast by my life now past its 42nd year, the first year of life that extends further than my own father’s was able.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everything we see is a shadow cast by that which we don’t see.” — Martin Luther King Jr
To digging deeper, friends. 🍻&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2017/05/28/seek-endarkenment</id>

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Random aside: if you look at the locations for these 12 years of birthday posts, you can see that they started on LiveJournal back in 2006 for the first 3 years, then they were on a Wordpress site I had for a long time (but which has since died and so I’ve archived them on Github), then 2 years on Tumblr, then 1 year on Svbtle, and the last 4 years have now been on Medium. I wouldn’t have guessed that Medium would remain my publishing platform of choice for longer than all of the others (other than maybe LiveJournal, which extends back to at least 2002). But here we are! I’m thankful for Medium and am happy to be an early adopter of their new membership experiment. Long live Medium!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;strong&gt;Life by Weeks&lt;/strong&gt; chart on busterbenson.com, two events stood out from the rest: Louie Phoenix Benson was born on August 6th, and Trump was elected on November 8th. They were quite different in terms of how I reacted to them. I also started writing a book about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/thinking-is-hard/4-conundrums-of-intelligence-2ab78d90740f&quot;&gt;how to draw better conclusions while avoiding bias&lt;/a&gt;, and took on a lead role at Slack for the platform team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;last-years-motto-mind-the-loops&quot;&gt;Last year’s motto: mind the loops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last year really was a lot about &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/28/mind-the-loop&quot;&gt;minding the loops&lt;/a&gt;. The now see feedback loops, and systems, and cycles everywhere I look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In product development:&lt;/strong&gt; What’s the right way to empower a messaging, communication, and workflow ecosystem to build businesses on other businesses? A system like this needs aligned incentives amongst a lot of different individuals, consistency, and trust.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In management:&lt;/strong&gt; How can I mentor and manage people at different parts of their careers? A career is a learning, testing, and iterating system with many different phases, breaks, setbacks, opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; What’s the best way to be a good father to a newborn, and a 6 year old, and how can I be a good husband and partner? A relationship is a system with loops on many different time scales.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In creativity:&lt;/strong&gt; What’s the best way to frame a creative project, like a book? Any form of exploration, discovery, and articulation is a system that requires a balance of seeking questions and answers, drafts and edits, proposals and agreements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s really true that the world isn’t linear — it’s loopy!&lt;/strong&gt; But the loops are so intricate, often untraceable, and interdependent, that minding them is only enjoyable if I also let myself get lost in them a bit. I mind them in the same way I mind the stars, and long distances of space and time… appreciating the glimpses I get, but not really getting to the bottom of anything. A loop has no bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the small glimpses I get, though, there’s a piece of the loops that has begun to stand out to me and it’s helped me understand why some systems are so difficult to understand or see. There’s often a stage within any system where things lose cohesion, or visibility, for extended periods. When a loop or a system gets tough to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the water cycle,&lt;/strong&gt; water can get stuck in the ocean, or underground, for millennia before resurfacing and dancing through clouds, streams, animals, and plants.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the life cycle,&lt;/strong&gt; the part where we die and our bodies turn back into dirt, and that dirt spends hundreds or thousands of years working through the occasional worm digestive track, and each individual mineral or atom ends up in one of a billion different plants, animals, and geographic elements before dispersing again… that sort of makes the cycle difficult to follow and truly picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most cycles have a dark part.&lt;/strong&gt; And darkness is generally not sought out, or invited into our explanations. We prefer ideas that sit nicely in an Occam’s Razor type of articulation. In the 4 conundrums model of how we understand the world, we filter out the dark parts of the world early and often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet. The dark part is so crucial. Without the vastness of empty space, everything would just be a giant ball of burning flames that crushed itself under its own weight. We need that darkness to create some sense of separation so that things can operate independently long enough to do something interesting. It’s only through extended separation that different species evolve. It’s only through the vast spaces between your brain and mine that we can think of each other as different people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the darkness of the world. With Trump in power, the darkness feels a bit overwhelming, and it’s obviously natural to want this era of darkness to end. But the pressure of that darkness is the churning motivation that will fuel the next era, whatever that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father died in the same year of his life that I’m entering of my own right now. I’m still recovering from that, and still resist attempting to imagine what it must have been like to say goodbye to wife and a son and a daughter, not to mention goodbye to one’s self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-years-motto-seek-endarkenment&quot;&gt;This year’s motto: seek endarkenment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it. The light is where everything is seen and understood (or where we at least think it is). Things make sense. There’s a shared understanding. A plan. But what do our eyes do in the light? Our pupils constrict. They narrow. And we get accustomed to the light and prefer to stay in it, where things are all figured out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the dark is where things can’t be seen. Especially when you’ve been in the light for a while. There is no plan. Nothing makes sense. But our pupils dilate and slowly adjust… there’s a seeking, a deep desire for exploration, curiosity, and we rely heavily on any tools or people around us to help us figure out what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If enlightenment is the desirable end state where everything has been brought into perfect clarity, endarkenment is the moment when we become comfortable in the darkness, in the lack of perfect clarity, when we’ve realize that we’re moving backwards, that we were wrong about a whole lot of things. Where we open our pupils, exposing ourselves to possible additional damage, but even so confidently seek the help of others because we need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with everything going on in the world with Trump, and hate, and backwards progress, in the spirit of seeking endarkenment I feel like my only path forward is to accept that we messed up. We became so obsessed with progress, and advancement, that we didn’t get everyone on the wagon. Not by a long shot. A huge chunk of the world isn’t progressing, isn’t advancing, even amongst the people we have around us, and it’s our fault for leaving them behind. Instead of spending hours every day reading about the latest terrible thing Trump has done, let’s instead start thinking about how we begin to include the people who have had the same salary for 20 years, even while everything has gotten more expensive and more inaccessible. Let’s seek endarkenment on this and see where it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-the-dark&quot;&gt;In the dark&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a some things I am a bit in the dark about at the moment, and am curious to see where they lead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What kind of human will Louie grow into this year?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is my book going to be any good? Am I going to make progress?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How will work culture and momentum continue to evolve?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What will happen to this country?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can I enable improvement and better outcomes in the above things?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do I make sure I stay healthy and happy and connected to the important people in my life along the way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to interpret discomfort in the dark as motivation to find the nearest answer. It’s a bit of an extension of the Spotlight Effect (where we only look for answers in areas that we feel clarity about). When we find ourselves in the dark, we assume the first answer/explanation we find is the right one. Instead, I’d like to sit in the dark a bit longer, let my eyes adjust a bit more, and wait for new information to slowly reveal itself, even if it’s quiet at first, and feels different than the answers I’m used to finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, I’m going to be spending a bit more time this year refactoring my &lt;a href=&quot;/beliefs&quot;&gt;codex&lt;/a&gt;. I’m testing having it hosted in a slightly more readable place in GitBook, which is pretty perfect for this use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in downloading my Book of Beliefs in an ebook format, you can let me know if this is useful at all by trying these links and letting me know how it goes: Kindle version, iBooks version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve sufficiently over-engineered my yearly report post. Have a nice day!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My favorite habit from this book is habit 5: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-5.html&quot;&gt;seek first to understand, then to be understood&lt;/a&gt;. Stephen Covey seemed to also share this favorite:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>40: Mind the loops</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2016/05/28/mind-the-loops"/>
   <updated>2016-05-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2016/05/28/mind-the-loops</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my 11th year of yearly birthday reflections. Here are the previous 10:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06-13-make-wiggle-room&quot;&gt;39: Make wiggle room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05-28-cultivate-quality-time&quot;&gt;38: Cultivate quality time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2013/05-28-more-kiloslogs&quot;&gt;37: More kiloslogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/05-28-talk-it-out&quot;&gt;36: Talk it out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2011/05-28-cultivate-the-core&quot;&gt;35: Love the struggle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2010/05-28-cultivate-the-core&quot;&gt;34: Cultivating the core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2009/05-28-frugal-to-the-max&quot;&gt;33: Frugal to the max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2008/05-27-no-problem&quot;&gt;32: No problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2007/05-29-double-down&quot;&gt;31: Double down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2006/05-31-higher-highs-lower-lows&quot;&gt;30: Higher highs and lower lows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;life-by-weeks&quot;&gt;Life by weeks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every week of my life is represented as a colored box on &lt;a href=&quot;http://busterbenson.com/&quot;&gt;busterbenson.com&lt;/a&gt;. The last green box is this week. The last white box is where (very roughly) my life is predicted to end. And there are 100 rows since my life goal is to ride a bike on my 100th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-life-by-weeks-1600x3106.png&quot; alt=&quot;Life by weeks&quot; caption=&quot;Life by weeks&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-life-by-weeks-1600x3106.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-life-by-weeks-1600x3106.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-life-by-weeks-1600x3106.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life moves fast, but it also moves slow. Every year (if I’m lucky) I get a new row. In the last few months, I’ve heard from a half dozen friends who are going through such difficult times (cancer, mental illness, unpredictable health incidents, etc) and right now especially, each box of this chart feels all the more tangible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I turn 40. My father died when he was 41. This year, Niko is 6 and a new baby will be added to our family in a couple months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is still just getting started. And yet, it is also at a point where the end doesn’t feel so far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We&amp;#39;re all in this together. 👶🎢☠&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Buster Benson (@buster) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/buster/status/724770953243193344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 26, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://flowingdata.com/2015/09/23/years-you-have-left-to-live-probably/&quot;&gt;neat simulation&lt;/a&gt; of when my life might end, according to data from the CDC. A 2% chance of dying in the next 10 years, 9% chance in the next 20 years, and somewhere a bit over a 90% chance that I won’t make it to 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-years-left-1600x893.png&quot; alt=&quot;Life by weeks&quot; caption=&quot;Life by weeks&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-years-left-1600x893.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-years-left-1600x893.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-years-left-1600x893.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how will I die? At this point, heart disease and external causes (like car accidents) are my most threatening factors. Cancer is creeping up though, and is probably a bit higher than represented here due to my family’s history with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-mortality-1600x1118.png&quot; alt=&quot;Life by weeks&quot; caption=&quot;Life by weeks&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-mortality-1600x1118.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-mortality-1600x1118.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-mortality-1600x1118.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causes of death (&lt;a href=&quot;http://flowingdata.com/2016/01/05/causes-of-death/&quot;&gt;try it&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about death and appreciating life go hand in hand. Yeah, it’s all a bit morbid, but it’s all part of the story here, might as well acknowledge it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-to-last-years-motto-make-wiggle-room&quot;&gt;Update to last year’s motto: make wiggle room&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, my birthday motto was to make wiggle room… which was my code word for finding the areas of my day, week, etc that could be turned into quality time. My commute was the biggest part of my day that had wiggle room potential, and I did a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://writtenonbart.com/&quot;&gt;writing on BART&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, near the end of that process, I began to realize that many of the things I was writing about were converging around an obsession with systems thinking, and I started planning a choose-your-own-adventure style book that would help teach systems thinking to Niko (and myself). Systems thinking is all about thinking about the loops: feedback loops, virtuous cycles, vicious cycles, karma, stock and flows, etc. If you aren’t sure what I’m talking about, this talk by Nicky Case does a fantastic job of explaining some of the most interesting bits of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a 3-slide summary of his talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy-800x450.png&quot; alt=&quot;Life by weeks&quot; caption=&quot;Life by weeks&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy-800x450.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy-800x450.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy-800x450.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy2-800x450.png&quot; alt=&quot;Life by weeks&quot; caption=&quot;Life by weeks&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy2-800x450.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy2-800x450.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy2-800x450.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy3-800x450.png&quot; alt=&quot;Life by weeks&quot; caption=&quot;Life by weeks&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy3-800x450.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy3-800x450.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-loopy3-800x450.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncase.me/OVC2016/&quot;&gt;whole talk is great&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The world is not linear, it’s loopy!
In addition to my commute, I found some wiggle room in the time in the evenings when Kellianne usually watch television and relax from the day. I still enjoy spending time with Kellianne, and relaxing, but now I have started drawing and working on this book as well (which is just being posted to Instagram a page at a time with the #lifeofclodia tag).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-years-motto-mind-the-loops&quot;&gt;This year’s motto: mind the loops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue my obsession with systems and loops this year, as several different parts of my life all contribute to the next row in my life by weeks chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years: Every year is one loop around the sun. I share a birthday with Ted Rheingold and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/season-of-the-witch/46th-orbit-around-the-sun-342a4c736385#.m1pk7qctg&quot;&gt;his birthday post&lt;/a&gt; today expressed this thought in a deeply moving way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family:&lt;/strong&gt; When this new baby is my age, I’ll be 80! I wonder what he’ll do on his 40th birthday. I’m trying to remember what my father did on his 40th birthday, but can’t and need to ask my sister and mom about it. These loops need to be traced!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt; I just want to appreciate the brief time we have with friends and family… whether you are healthy or sick, happy or sad, doing really well or struggling mightily, I am grateful for you and would love to spend some quality time with you this year. We are all looping through life, together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work:&lt;/strong&gt; At work, the mission is to make the working lives of people simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. And a prerequisite to doing that is also caring about our own work lives in that same way. The attitude towards work makes the product, and the product makes the attitude towards work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interests:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose your own adventure stories are loopy, not linear. My book won’t have any endings, every branch will return back into the book in some way. The reward here is really just sharing each page with Niko and Kellianne, getting feedback, and making new pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codex:&lt;/strong&gt; My core beliefs inform my actions, and my actions inform my core beliefs. Every year I revisit my list of beliefs and make sure they’re up-t0-date and capture all the things that I’ve recently been thinking about. Next weekend I’ll be spending a couple days with a few close friends and I want to discuss these beliefs in more detail… I’ll have a bigger update about that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 years ago, I had a polar bear, live interpretive painting, Reggie Watts and Daniel Spils playing weird music, embarrassing interviews on stage, a raffle for a hot air balloon ride, and lots of other absurdity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-vladmir-1024x768.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Vladmir the polar bear&quot; caption=&quot;Vladmir the polar bear&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-vladmir-1024x768.jpeg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-vladmir-1024x768.jpeg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-vladmir-1024x768.jpeg 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I had a really nice long walk with Kellianne, a delicious brunch, and plan a relaxing weekend of napping, drawing, house-work, and writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-me-1080x1080.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-me-1080x1080.jpeg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-me-1080x1080.jpeg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/mind-the-loops-me-1080x1080.jpeg 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is all good. Have a great year!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>39: Make wiggle room</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2015/06/13/make-wiggle-room"/>
   <updated>2015-06-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2015/06/13/make-wiggle-room</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my 10th year of yearly birthday reflections. Here are the previous 9:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05-28-cultivate-quality-time&quot;&gt;38: Cultivate quality time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2013/05-28-more-kiloslogs&quot;&gt;37: More kiloslogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/05-28-talk-it-out&quot;&gt;36: Talk it out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2011/05-28-cultivate-the-core&quot;&gt;35: Love the struggle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2010/05-28-cultivate-the-core&quot;&gt;34: Cultivating the core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2009/05-28-frugal-to-the-max&quot;&gt;33: Frugal to the max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2008/05-27-no-problem&quot;&gt;32: No problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2007/05-29-double-down&quot;&gt;31: Double down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2006/05-31-higher-highs-lower-lows&quot;&gt;30: Higher highs and lower lows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also the 7th anniversary of my &lt;strong&gt;8:36pm project&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekwire.com/2012/day-rest-life/&quot;&gt;see the story here&lt;/a&gt;). This year I took a photo at 8:36pm on only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=35034346886%40N01&amp;amp;sort=interestingness-desc&amp;amp;advanced=1&amp;amp;text=8%3A36%20OR%208%3A36pm&amp;amp;view_all=1&amp;amp;min_taken_date=1401346800&amp;amp;max_taken_date=1432882799&quot;&gt;310 out of the 365 days&lt;/a&gt;, missing 55, for a fairly low 85% success rate. Over the 7 years in all I’ve taken a photo on 2,402 of the 2,562 days, for an overall success rate of 94%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life by weeks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life moves fast, but it also moves slow. I have a chart on &lt;a href=&quot;http://busterbenson.com/&quot;&gt;busterbenson.com&lt;/a&gt; which maps out my life by weeks: every square is a week of my life, and every row is a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look for events that are significant enough to leave a mark on this chart (I sometimes refer to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://wayoftheduck.com/life-change-score&quot;&gt;life change list&lt;/a&gt; which comes from a list of things that are known to alter the quality of your life). Things of the scale like getting married, having a kid, moving, starting a new job, reaching a big personal goal, etc. Last year, only 1 thing met this criteria, which was buying a house in September. (Changing jobs happened slightly after my birthday… this post is a couple weeks late.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The black dot at the bottom of the chart, in August of 2052, is around where I’m expected to die &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy&quot;&gt;at the age of 76&lt;/a&gt; if I life a perfectly average life. All that white space is a blank slate for the rest of my life… it’s good to stare at it frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-on-last-years-motto-cultivate-quality-time&quot;&gt;Update on last year’s motto: cultivate quality time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 38th year was marked by obsession with quality time. I continue to find new connections between it and every part of my life. Unlike many other pursuits, such as going directly after happiness, reputation, approval, security, or money, it doesn’t seem to be game-able. By which I mean the relentless pursuit of quality time doesn’t end up turning you into a person who loses touch with the most important things in life. There’s no way to try to have more quality time with your family, or with your work, or with your hobbies, or with yourself, and end up being an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultivating quality time, making time for yourself, your interests, your friends, and your family… it really is what life is all about, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-years-motto-make-wiggle-room&quot;&gt;This year’s motto: make wiggle room&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is sort of a continuation of last year’s motto, because I am starting to believe that the way to best cultivate quality time is to simply make room for it. For example, a great way to increase quality time with Kellianne is to make sure we have a regular date night. Just having space for my relationship helps make quality time happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I think of it as wiggle room is because making space is also pretty tough. Certain parts of my life are very difficult to change. For example, the length of my commute is pretty static. However, the wiggle room I have involves what I do on that commute. I’ve been listening to a lot of audiobooks on my commute for the last couple years, and just last month I started writing really short posts (with lots of typos and hurried endings) on BART, and tagging them all &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/tag/written-on-bart&quot;&gt;#writtenonbart&lt;/a&gt;. The revelation to me was that rather than fight against the constraints that are tough to change, look for parts of my day that have a bit of wiggle room and then look for a way to use space that in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting coincidence of life is that I just started working at Slack, and people sometimes comment on its funny name. But there’s this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our name may seem funny, but think on this: without slack, there is no reach, no play, no flexibility, no learning, no evolution, no growth.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Slack (@SlackHQ) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/431862004895076352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 7, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here’s to finding new ways to make wiggle room this year, and to bringing quality time into those cracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with this yearly review, I also did a big edit/re-organization to my beliefs in the &lt;a href=&quot;/beliefs&quot;&gt;Codex&lt;/a&gt;, which I wrote up &lt;a href=&quot;https://writtenonbart.com/4-kinds-of-beliefs-44dce1c04093&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll continue to do my monthly reviews there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/make-wiggle-room-lifecycle-1200x750.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kellianne finishing the AIDS Lifecycle ride&quot; caption=&quot;Kellianne finishing the AIDS Lifecycle ride&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/make-wiggle-room-lifecycle-1200x750.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/make-wiggle-room-lifecycle-1200x750.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/make-wiggle-room-lifecycle-1200x750.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niko and I meet Kellianne at the finish line of her AIDS/LifeCycle ride.
I think this is going to be a good year. Next time I do one of these yearly reviews, I’ll be 40! 😬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great year! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Element of Irreducible Rascality</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2015/05/27/the-element-of-irreducible-rascality"/>
   <updated>2015-05-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2015/05/27/the-element-of-irreducible-rascality</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite phrases coined by Alan Watts, who I’ve been immersing myself in over the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of the element of irreducible rascality is that there is no perfect system. There’s no ultimate stability in anything: physical, logical, emotional, or spiritual. At the bottom of every hole, at the end of every train of thought, and behind even the most powerful structures, is a little rascal that will undo it all.
It’s the exception to every rule, including this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the universe is balanced on the top of a turtle’s back, and that turtle is balanced on top of another turtle’s back, and the turtles go all the way down, then the element of irreducible rascality is at the bottom, holding nothing, standing on nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The element of irreducible rascality created the first creator, and nothing created it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the paradox that ties together the two ends of infinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think you’ve figured it out, it throws in a new wrench. It has infinite wrenches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the set of all sets that don’t include itself include itself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you stop kicking the king of Jupiter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find strange comfort in the element of irreducible rascality. The groundlessness of all things. The merging of cause and effect, particle and wave, light and shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the antidote to one-upmansip and the friend of craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The element of irreducible rascality will subvert any desire for permanence, stability, of certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its place is an appreciation for how a thing is done, for savoring, for gratitude, for connection.
Imagine that you want to prepare for a perfect future. You somehow manage to amass unlimited wealth and become ruler of the world. What do you do? You solve every problem that the world has. Everyone lives forever, is always healthy, empathic, and intelligent. Space travel is solved. Time travel is solved. Multidimensional travel is solved. Universal respect and equality is established between all beings. Everything is hilarious, creativity and self-expression come naturally, and there’s ample time to yourself as well as with loved ones and new acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The element of irreducible rascality will wiggle in and create new problems, new uncertainties, new ways to trip us up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not because it’s ill-intentioned, but because it’s just a little rascal, and ultimately we need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a part of us and a part of the universe. We try to suppress this element, but it’s irreducible, and a part of every thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, when all problems are solved, and new problems emerge, the element of irreducible rascality calls us again to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to get rid of it this whole time, we could play with it and enjoy its company even amidst all of our problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to one-up the universe, we can become craftsmen and craftswomen of rascality. Enjoying the problems and the solutions. Creating problems and solutions. Destroying problems and solutions. Flipping the coin and playing the game with equal heart whether we win or lose, because the element of irreducible rascality will be there with us either way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Self-coaching experiment results</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2014/11/29/self-coaching-experiment-results"/>
   <updated>2014-11-29T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2014/11/29/self-coaching-experiment-results</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;These are notes on my coaching experiment that’s taking place on Lift. The program is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lift.do/coaches/414-buster-benson?plan_id=354515&quot;&gt;Look before you Lift&lt;/a&gt; and Batch 2 will be opening up soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batch 1 date:&lt;/strong&gt; 11/13/2014 - 11/19/2014&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Number of coachees:&lt;/strong&gt; 9&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a 1-week guided self-reflection program that can be used before you get started on your other Lift goals or after you’ve lapsed from something that worked for a while. I hope to help you reveal the hidden obstacles that trip you up whenever you attempt to change your behavior in a way that sticks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With a short casual semi-structured chat every day, we’ll talk and learn about old and new obstacles in your life, understand what keeps them there, what they’re blocking, and how they’re connected together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By the end of a week I hope to help you have at least one new idea for a new Lift goal that has a high chance of succeeding and improving the quality of your life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First question is: Which 1-3 of these things could you use more of today? energy, clarity, human connection, productivity, fun, none, or other. We’ll build from there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And of course, if it doesn’t work out for any reason, I’ll refund the full cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a week of casual conversation with 9 people, here are some results&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2/9 dropped out before getting very far and I never heard from them again&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;3/9 made some progress but didn’t complete my end-of-week survey&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;4/9 completed my end-of-week survey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of those 4 who completed the end-of-week survey:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;100% said “We talked about an objective in my life that is important to me”.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;75% said “I identified at least 1 hidden reason that was blocking me from my objective”.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;50% said “I discovered a new idea for a Lift goal that will help me towards my objective”.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;And 25% said “I learned something new about myself”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When rated 1-10 on likelihood of recommending the program to peers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 rated it 10&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 rated it 8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviews posted with their permission:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From my end, this was the briefest and most to-the-point coaching interaction I’ve been part of (which is actually a lot of them!) but it still seemed effective in solving a specific problem. My suspicion is that the most effective interventions are more brief, more focused on a single problem and lead to working on one new habit/action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Brief, direct questions drilled down to the root of my problem quickly. Left conversation with a specific, measurable way to make progress. Asynchronous a plus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Buster’s slow and methodical approach uncovers personal narratives that prevent you from achieving your goals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Buster has an uncanny ability to read your emotionally charged messages and distill them into actionable goals. He asks all the right ?s.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Buster slowly and patiently encourages you to understand yourself. It’s methodical and illuminating.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lift.do/coaches/414-buster-benson?plan_id=354515&quot;&gt;Join the next batch from here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Better than meditation</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2014/10/22/better-than-meditation"/>
   <updated>2014-10-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2014/10/22/better-than-meditation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Meditation is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty much the simplest, cheapest way to improve your life that has ever been invented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem with meditation is that it’s just too simple. I can’t get a hold of it for very long — it resists habitification. Maybe you know what I’m talking about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coach.me/users/d14c5c4c29dbab4b3b4b/activity&quot;&gt;Coach.me&lt;/a&gt; I’ve had a few stretches of 4+ straight months where I meditated pretty much every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve used Headspace. I’ve used Brain Beats. I’ve used Equanimity. I’ve used nothing. I’ve used NSR. I’ve read The Power of Now, Waking Up, Creativity Inc, Wherever You Go There You Are, Search Inside Yourself. I’ve done a 10 day silent meditation retreat. I’ve meditated on BART, on walks, on a cushion in a private room, at my desk. I get meditation, with its paradoxical mission of focusing so intently on not focusing on anything at all. I’ve done “it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s something slippery about meditation. I can never quite get a good grip on it. I feel like someone with Alzheimer’s waking up each morning having the same conversation with myself about who stole my shoes, then some stranger I’ve never seen before gently informs me that they’re right where I put them the night before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-people-in-my-head&quot;&gt;The people in my head&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I learned during my silent meditation retreat is that my head is full of random voices. When I stopped talking for a while, the voices slowly started running out of things to say, and I could start telling them apart. Some voices had different characters, even. Different standard dialogues, different tones. After about 4 days they disappeared entirely. When my meditation practice is moving along pretty well, it’s possible for me to listen to the voices in my head without identifying with them directly. The rest of the time they’re so familiar to me that I usually don’t hear them… their thoughts are my thoughts. But I always know they’re there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sam Harris’s recent book, Waking Up, which I recommend, he mentions a couple of these similar themes that always come up. How in some ways our minds are not singular. You can cut the corpus callosum and essentially have 2 minds that are both “you” living side by side in the same head. Daniel Kahneman, in Thinking Fast and Slow, also highly recommended, breaks it down into System 1 (the fast, intuitive, automatic, emotional brain) and System 2 (the rational, guiding, intentional brain). In Marvin Minsky’s Society of Mind, yes, highly recommended, he talks about how our brains could be considered to be an entire community of partial minds, with a throne (the self) that appoints leaders to run things, and that throne goes through power struggles, times of revolution and times of dictatorship and times of peaceful solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I personally have &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/10-18-universe-soloverse&quot;&gt;a weird theory&lt;/a&gt; that our brains are running a constant simulation of the universe, which includes models for our self, other people, other forces, in order to tell a story about the past and predict the future.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, one of the primary benefits of meditation (for me) has been that it has pushed me along this long learning curve about the voices, people, models, simulations in my head — the ability to hear, and observe, the inner debate that’s always going on in my head, and to recognize the difference between “me” and all the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;better-than-meditation-free-writing&quot;&gt;Better than meditation: free writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run this site called &lt;a href=&quot;/750-words&quot;&gt;750words.com&lt;/a&gt;, which was built in 2009 and was inspired by the concept of morning pages as described in &lt;a href=&quot;/influences/julia-cameron/&quot;&gt;Julia Cameron&lt;/a&gt;’s book, &lt;a href=&quot;/influences/julia-cameron/julia-cameron-the-artists-way/&quot;&gt;The Artist’s Way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic rules of free writing were captured pretty nicely by Natalie Goldberg (lightly edited version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing&quot;&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give yourself a word limit. Write for 1, 2, or 3 pages, and then stop.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep writing until the time is up. Do not pause to stare into space or to read what you’ve written. Write quickly but not in a hurry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pay no attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, neatness, or style. Nobody else should ever read what you produce here. The correctness and quality of what you write do not matter; the act of writing does.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you get off the topic or run out of ideas, keep writing anyway. If necessary, write nonsense or whatever comes into your head: anything to keep the words flowing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you feel bored or uncomfortable as you’re writing, ask yourself what’s bothering you and write about that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the similarities to meditation. The specific limitation of time, the gentle persistence of staying on track during that time, being an observer rather than a critic of what’s happening in your head, stay on track, stay on track, let the ideas flow and just watch them, stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I think free writing is better than meditation, especially for those of us who constantly slip from the practice, is that &lt;strong&gt;it includes solid grips on slippery thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;. The act of typing serves as a hand rail on our thoughts, and occupies a certain part of the brain that generally gets restless and looks for something to do, because it’s already doing something: typing. Disabling that restless squirrel in your brain is the reason why activities like walking, showering, doing the dishes, gardening, etc are all such great activities for stirring up creative thoughts. Free writing has the added benefit of providing a tangible trail of thoughts as they rise up. You’re essentially hitching your subconscious directly to your typing fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As you write, you also read what you’re writing. Sometimes I suspect that certain parts of my brain are seeing the words for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;know-yourself-better&quot;&gt;Know yourself better&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a fountain of thoughts bubbling up from your subconscious. Your conscious brain receives these bubbling thoughts during meditation, and we often get caught up in one and float away in a thought bubble. Eventually it pops, and we’re back, but it’s a lot of work. With free writing, we have a convenient method to step back from the fountain and observe the bubbles and let them float away on their own… because we are too busy recording them. The separation between thought and self becomes easier to discern and maintain, the same way that carrying a camera around a party creates a separation between party and party recorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for this to work, the typing has to be truly free. This means that the critical, editing, judging, vetoing, guiding, interpreting part of your brain — the neocortex—has to be almost entirely disabled. The easiest way to make this happen is to type into a box that can’t be opened by others. This is why I think 750 Words serves an important purpose. While other journaling tools may have more features, I will never let anything typed on 750 Words be public. These words are typed into a box (and are searchable by you) but they won’t ever get cross-posted to your blog, or to Facebook, or found under your bed, or on your computer. Creating this level of privacy for your words is the only way your neocortex can let down its guard, and let the real words out, so that you (and the rest of your brain) can read them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/351538855/the-source-of-creativity&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Chapter 2 of this episode of NPR Radio Hour&lt;/a&gt; goes into a bit more detail about the value of shutting down your neocortex and its relationship to creativity and flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 5 years I’ve done about 350,000 words of free writing, and it has helped me know myself better than anything else I’ve done in that time. If you’re frustrated with meditation, and haven’t tried free writing in this way before, it’s worth looking into. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>3-lane product development</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2014/08/10/3-lane-product-development"/>
   <updated>2014-08-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2014/08/10/3-lane-product-development</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you want to build an amazing product or start an amazing company. Where to start? Here are 3 lanes (Existential/WHY, Experimental/WHAT, &amp;amp; Execution/HOW) that work for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lane-1-the-existential-lane-discover-why-you-should-exist&quot;&gt;Lane 1: The Existential Lane. Discover WHY you should exist.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out what you want to have an impact on. How do you want to change people? Make them happier? More productive? Better at their jobs? Choose your North Star, the ultimate outcome you want to increase in the universe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who do you want to have this impact on? Do you have a way to reach these people? Do they want to change? If not, you might want to pick different people unless you can think of a way to change them without requiring any effort from them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changing people is tough. You probably don’t even know how to change yourself very well. Multiply that by a million to estimate how difficult it is to change someone else… much less change many someone elses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One way to change people is to find something that they’re doing that’s important to them. Find out why it’s important to them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Draw out the steps that they use to do this important thing. Do this by actually talking to them directly, not by using your imagination.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a step that you can remove (therefore making something easier, or faster) using technology or second order effects of technology. The step can be physical (replace mailing letters with just hitting send), mental (replace remembering everyone’s phone numbers with tapping names), or emotional (replace feeling alone with hanging out on your favorite website). The removal of that step, whatever it is, is the impact you’re having, the reason you exist—make sure it maps to your North Star. You’re changing people (and the world) only as much as you’re making something easier or faster for them, increasing their efficiency at their current tasks (and usually not changing their values). Your total addressable market is only as large as the set of people who were doing the initial step that you are now proposing to remove, and the money they’re willing to part with in order to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;However you remove the step, be very mindful that you don’t introduce new steps that are more cumbersome than the step you’re removing (fyi even downloading and opening an app is a highly cumbersome step). It’s very easy to forget that your new step has actual weight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there are no steps that you can imagine removing without introducing new steps equally or more cumbersome, try new ideas in this lane. Otherwise, continue on…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you measure whether or not you are changing people and having a positive impact on their lives? The most popular way is to measure how many people are using your product instead of what they used to do. Weekly active users, for example. Even better, recurring weekly active users. Even better, time spent by recurring weekly active users. Even better, time well spent by recurring weekly active users (meaning that the time is spent in a manner that they’d categorize positively). Another way is to ask them directly how likely they are to recommend your product to others, aka Net Promoter Score. There are others but versions of those could work pretty well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the cultivation of this measurement of impact a core value of your culture—one that every person at the company or team can recall from memory. This means tracking it consistently, distributing the results, over-communicating it to the point of ridiculousness, and remembering how the number has changed over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The output of this lane is a core metric that everyone knows and trusts. Everyone on your team / at your company should be able to tell you what number you’re trying to move, why it’s a trustworthy measure of positive impact, and what the number currently is. Return to this lane if any of these things comes into doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lane-2-the-experimental-lane-discover-what-will-move-the-needle&quot;&gt;Lane 2: The Experimental Lane. Discover WHAT will move the needle.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a handle on why you should exist, what you want to impact, and you have a way to track impact over time, it’s time to enter the second lane of product development: where you test and validate opportunities in their ability to move the needle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using the whole team, brainstorm big opportunities. Crazy Eights is a one of my favorite exercises for this. After you talk through divergent ideas, give rough estimates (like t-shirt sizes) for how much impact it could make based on your North Star, how much work it would take to build, and how confident you are that these rough estimates are accurate. Collect these opportunities in the experiments backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find quick, cheap experiments to improve the rough estimates for the highest impact opportunities. Use A/B tests, user research, concierge prototypes, and any other scrappy, quick, cheap ways to improve accuracy and confidence in estimates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When an opportunity tests low on it’s impact to work ratio, archive it as “won’t do”. When an opportunity tests high on its impact to work ratio, move it into lane 3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue to brainstorm new opportunities and add them to the experiments backlog as you learn more about how to move the needle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The output of this lane is a continuous stream of high confidence opportunities that will move the needle. These items move into lane 3: execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lane-3-the-execution-lane-discover-how-to-deliver-highest-impact-to-the-core-metric&quot;&gt;Lane 3: The Execution Lane. Discover HOW to deliver highest impact to the core metric.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By the time something is in this lane, it should be a relatively safe bet that it will have a high impact relative to the work it requires. The only question, then, is whether or not it should be added to the next sprint. Sort the items in this lane by your available resources (how many people you have, how much time they have available, do they have the right skills to get it done, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build and ship these things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every time something ships, go back to the original estimates of impact and amount of work, and verify their accuracy. Did it take as long to ship as you thought? Did it actually move the needle like you thought?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get smarter, look for blind spots, make corrections, repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The output of this lane is a continuous stream of shipped changes and results that can be measured in lane 1. As the team learns about its ability to estimate time and impact, it can use this feedback loop to make better estimates in lane 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-practice-at-twitter&quot;&gt;In practice at Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some thoughts on how I apply these ideas to my team at Twitter, which is about a dozen people, mostly engineers though also design, user research, product marketing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These three lanes are designed to run in parallel.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re not starting in lane 1, then moving to lane 2, then moving to lane 3, then starting over at lane 1 again. I think of them as literal lanes around a track, with ideas running in each one constantly. There are only a two ideas in lane 1, and they move pretty slowly and are tightly coupled. There are dozens if not hundreds of ideas in lane 2, constantly bumping, crashing, burning, and occasionally weaving masterfully through the impossible. Then, in lane 3, there are only a few ideas running, though they are much less likely to run into trouble down the road. Trouble in outer lanes causes us to shift attention to inner lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first lane is our slowest track,&lt;/strong&gt; and often only needs to be revisited every quarter or even year. When it is revisited, the whole team is involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second lane is the fastest lane with the most drama,&lt;/strong&gt; and probably takes up a majority amount of time from a core team (perhaps a rotating 20% of the team) dedicated to discovery, experimentation, and brainstorming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The third lane is more stable and reactive.&lt;/strong&gt; It eats the backlog, and maps closest to traditional agile development, with 1-2 week sprints, etc. The main difference is that the backlog only includes items with good estimates for impact and work and that have high confidence / high impact on your primary metric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven’t mastered this by any means, so there’s always room for postmortems, course corrections, re-evaluation, and improvement. But it’s something that feels right, and the reward to date has been in shipping stuff (like the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://analytics.twitter.com/user/*/tweets&quot;&gt;Tweet analytics dashboard&lt;/a&gt;) that we’re all proud of, and that make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also the 6th anniversary-ish of my 8:36pm project (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekwire.com/2012/day-rest-life/&quot;&gt;see the story here&lt;/a&gt;). This year I took a photo at 8:36pm on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=8%3A36pm&amp;amp;safe_search=3&amp;amp;content_type=7&amp;amp;media=all&amp;amp;user_id=35034346886%40N01&amp;amp;min_taken_date=1369612800&amp;amp;max_taken_date=1401148800&amp;amp;adv=1&amp;amp;sort=date-posted-desc&quot;&gt;339 out of the 365 days&lt;/a&gt;, missing 26, for a 93% success rate. Over the 6 years in all I’ve taken a photo on 2,114 of the 2,197 days, for an overall success rate of 96.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-on-last-years-motto-more-kiloslogs&quot;&gt;Update on last year’s motto: more kiloslogs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 37th year started off on an exploration of the kiloslog, which is my made-up word representing the idea of working slowly towards a distant goal (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/better-humans/52167e196771&quot;&gt;1 Metric Kiloslog&lt;/a&gt; for a full explanation). I set the goal to do 1,000 small things that would get me closer to running a marathon. I’ve been thinking about this all year and ended up finally going on a couple 5+ mile runs in the last few weeks after spending almost an entire year working on knee issues. I actually felt quite victorious even with this small goal since the frustration of this particular knee issue has felt extremely frustrating in its lack of progress despite PT, stretching, and lots of patience. I’m still not entirely sure that I’ll be able to fully recover without giving in to knee surgery, but since it’s gotten a bit better recently I’m holding out hope. That said, I also have a referral for a good local orthopedic surgeon to take a look the second I lose hope. I did stop using technology to track my progress around 900/1000, because I found that the work of tracking was as difficult as the work itself. A common theme in my frustrations with quantified self and self-tracking in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to working on the kiloslog towards running a marathon, I’ve also started fixating on an even longer-term health vision: to ride a bike on my 100th birthday. I like thinking about this for a couple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a silly visualization.&lt;/strong&gt; I can actually sort of picture myself, aged 100, getting on a bike and wobbling down the street. Perhaps a crowd is cheering me on. Perhaps we live in a cloud city and we’re all cyborgs. The daydream is ripe with material to play around with.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It gives my health goal a purpose.&lt;/strong&gt; The intrinsic motivation that this taps into is part of my core quality of life motivation. I want to enjoy a long, healthy life, for the purposes of enjoying it all the way through to a simple activity on my 100th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s flexible in the short-term but encourages long-term consistency.&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t have to sweat the small things that aren’t going to make a long-term impact, simply because they are part of some program that’s supposed to have a short term impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This single, silly, vivid health vision informs my eating habits, my exercise routine (for the kiloslog and other stuff), my stress levels, my creativity, and my social habits. It’s a single ribbon that ties it all together, paces me, keeps and makes me happy to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you like to do on your 100th birthday? Replace 100th birthday with whatever birthday you think represents the pinnacle of a life worth living. If you think of something, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@buster%20On%20my%20100th%20birthday,%20I%27d%20like%20to%20&quot;&gt;tweet it to me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s basically where my thoughts on behavior change, health-improvement, and quantified self ended up for the year. Nothing earth-shattering or billion dollar start-up worthy, but it feels right to me and I’m gonna stick with it for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-ideas-for-the-new-year&quot;&gt;New ideas for the new year&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple themes / ideas have been swirling around in my head, seemingly unconnected for the most part. The kiloslog mentioned above is one of them. Here are some very brief descriptions of a few others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Codex Vitae:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751&quot;&gt;Mr Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that you write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything you have learned in your life. You work on drafts your entire life and it gets stored and read by a privileged few upon your death. Expanding a bit further on it, I think this is a great way of thinking about self-expression. Our lives are filled with a desire to know the universe, and to be known. To leave a dent. This is just my English-major-y way of representing the dent in the form of a text, because words are so cool. Maybe one day we’ll be able to download our brains into a computer and that would more directly represent our full body of knowledge from life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Time:&lt;/strong&gt; My own Codex Vitae’s first chapter could possibly be about quality time and its role as the primary ends (and means) for a fulfilled life. I see 3 kinds of quality time that we should seek out. The first is quality time with our own selves. Know thyself, and in the process find our deep interests and find people that we can connect deeply with. The second is quality time with those interests, and the third is quality time with those people we can connect deeply with. They each feed into each other, you can’t really connect deeply with others until you know yourself sufficiently well. And often times interests are strengthened by having people you can connect with and share with. It seems pretty ungameable to me. Seek quality time with yourself, your interests, and others and you will not regret anything on your death bed (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/better-humans/20cc8d9c7494&quot;&gt;The Death Bed Game&lt;/a&gt; for more thoughts around that).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optionality:&lt;/strong&gt; Or, as Nassim Nicolas Taleb calls it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/1400067820/&quot;&gt;antifragility&lt;/a&gt;. I like the word optionality because it seems more neutral, almost boring even, and yet it is probably one of the most simple and powerful ideas that I’ve ever encountered. The easiest way to describe it is the degree to which your eggs are in different baskets. The more baskets, and the more eggs, and the more evenly distributed those eggs are in those baskets, the higher the optionality. The beauty of optionality is that it has both protective and self-strengthening qualities. Say that you have 12 eggs in 1 basket. If something happens to that basket, all of your eggs are doomed (low optionality). On the other hand, say that you have 12 eggs in 6 baskets (2 in each). If something happens to one of the baskets, you still have 10 eggs (higher optionality). Now imagine that you have 12 eggs in 12 baskets, and every time one of the baskets is destroyed, one of the other eggs hatches and creates 2 new eggs and you get 2 new baskets. Now, say that all of the eggs are different colors, and that there are monsters that prefer certain colors of eggs for breakfast. As the monsters wake up every morning and have breakfast, the type of eggs that they like will become more rare. There will be more eggs left from colors that they don’t like. In a way, the set of eggs will become stronger (less likely to be eaten). This is how high optionality works. The final twist is that in order for this to really work, it has to have some level of randomness involved… because what if the monster also adapts over time and begins to prefer new colors of eggs… in order for the set of eggs to be safe from complete elimination, there should be enough variation in the colors that some eggs won’t get eaten… and that those eggs will hatch and grow and the population of future eggs will represent eggs that are less appetizing to monster. Optionality is the key to natural selection and evolution. It’s also the key to idea generation, investment strategy, product management, and many other things. Qualities of high optionality things include:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. &lt;em&gt;A variety of options that aren’t connected to one another.&lt;/em&gt; For example, if you have 3 green eggs in 3 baskets and a green-egg eating monster comes, you’re going to lose all of your eggs even though they were in different baskets. Same if you own 3 different houses that are all on the same block and it gets hit by a flood, or 3 different emerging tech stocks when the equity markets dry up. True variety would imply that a disaster of any kind won’t take out all of your options… at least 1 must survive and it needs to be a strong one that has traits that led to its survival. Another word to describe this is that the options must be diversified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. &lt;em&gt;There should be relatively quick feedback loops.&lt;/em&gt; The period of time between “something bad happens” and “the population shifts to favor the stronger options” should be short. If 10 bad things happen before the population adapts, the optionality is lower than if it only takes 1 or 2 bad things to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. &lt;em&gt;The adaptations must have some element of randomness.&lt;/em&gt; In other words, variety must not decrease over time, even if the environment becomes predictable. Eventually the environment will change in a new way, and then the variety will need to be sufficient to survive an unexpected change. If a green-egg eating monster turns into a red-egg eating monster, there should be some non-red eggs, and maybe even some green eggs, around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes logical sense, but in practice it seems counter-intuitive to build systems with high optionality. We tend to build systems that converge on a single design over time (see monocultures) because they are predictable and efficient in a given environment. But environments change, and without the ability to predict how those changes will happen ahead of time, optionality is required even in the safest of environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rambled on even longer about this topic here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/better-humans/c02337782a89&quot;&gt;Live like a hydra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soloverse:&lt;/em&gt; This is the least-fully-formed idea of the bunch and something that I’m sure will shift over time. The universe is this giant space/time environment that we are all a part of. The soloverse is our mental model of the universe that our brain uses to think about the universe and everything in it. It turns out, we can’t really think about the universe directly (it’s way too big), we can only think about our mental model of the universe as it exists in our soloverse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first came across this idea last year and found some interesting explorations of the idea referenced by the word umwelt, which is German for “environment” or “surroundings” and pronounced &lt;em&gt;ooom-velt&lt;/em&gt;. I just made up the term soloverse because it’s easier for me to think of it as a private universe in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts about soloverses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. &lt;em&gt;The soloverse is our local cache of the universe.&lt;/em&gt; When we’re babies, our caches are not very primed, and we are forced to take in the full firehose of the universe… unsorted, uncategorized, raw. It’s overwhelming. Our brains are designed to start building this soloverse almost immediately in order to gain some foothold on the raw craziness of all the information coming in. The soloverse is built up from basic building blocks like light and dark, smells, sounds, and eventually patterns (mom, hungry, cold, soft), and then eventually concepts (blanket, food) and meanings (safe, scared, good, bad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. &lt;em&gt;What we think of as the universe is actually our soloverse.&lt;/em&gt; From these basic building blocks we create beliefs and build simulations that allow us to predict future occurrences (if I cry, mom will come to me). At some point we arrive at a concept of our own selves and other people. “The concept of a person is arguably the most important interface ever developed.” — Kevin Smokler&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. &lt;em&gt;The soloverse contains gods and archetypes.&lt;/em&gt; Some of our most powerful beliefs and traditional characters (God, the hero, the devil, the wizard, the fairy godmother) all exist only in our soloverses. Unicorns, dragons, Santa, astrology, luck, fairness, truth, good and evil, beginning middle and end, physics, etc are all shadows of the structure that our soloverse is running on (our brains, and the pattern matching hierarchies that they are built from) and most likely absent from the universe that they are attempting to model. This quirk is actually really fascinating to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D. &lt;em&gt;The soloverse is the most powerful tool we have.&lt;/em&gt; The model of the universe that we each have is highly personal, and idiosyncratic to the experiences we’ve had. There are also large portions of which there is probably lots of overlap (common sense, myths, popular culture, things we learn in school, etc). An unhealthy soloverse could lead to poor/misinformed decision-making. An unhealthy soloverse could be responsible for cruelty, prejudice, hatred, wars, and all kinds of other unfortunate things. What could we do to help ourselves and each other have healthier soloverses? Could we address this issue directly and have an impact?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E. &lt;em&gt;A comprehensively complete soloverse must also model every other soloverse that exists.&lt;/em&gt; In order to build a real “to scale” model of the universe it has to also include every other soloverse out there, including itself. We can’t escape our personal soloverse, but we can make it a more hospitable place to live in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-motto-cultivate-quality-time&quot;&gt;A new motto: cultivate quality time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last 9 years now I’ve been doing some sort of birthday review. And for the last year I’ve been doing a monthly report that I send out to a small group of friends (inspired by Nick Crocker’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/health-the-future/182870501589&quot;&gt;Elephants&lt;/a&gt;) with a quick update on monthly progress, some personal stuff, and a hello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultivating quality time means a couple things to me: it means attempting to remove circumstances that hinder quality time, and it means attempting to put into place or strengthen circumstances that encourage quality time. In my time using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reporter-app.com/&quot;&gt;Reporter&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/buster-benson/7da6f22b8e2c&quot;&gt;How I track my life&lt;/a&gt;) to get a better sense of the conditions that hinder and encourage quality time, the lowest hanging fruit appeared to be the condition of being well-rested. But I don’t want to get too pre-occupied with lowest hanging fruit. I want to build a sustainable style of living that supports frequent course correction (ie has optionality) towards quality time cultivation and which favors long-term sustainability over short-term momentum (ie behaves like a kiloslog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’ve come up with, in the form of a draft codex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prototype-of-a-codex-vitae&quot;&gt;Prototype of a Codex Vitae:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-to-play&quot;&gt;How to play&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every day: In the morning, read the list under Review Every Day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every month: On the 1st of every month, read the list under Review Every Month.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every year: On your birthday, read the list under Review Every Year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;review-every-day&quot;&gt;Review Every Day&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I’d like to have primed in my brain every morning. This is stuff currently churning in the front of my brain, which probably has high turnover but which also has a good chance of getting somewhere new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seek quality time: With myself, with other people, and with my interests.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look at what’s uncomfortable: Don’t avoid the unresolved, unwanted, conflicted things that would benefit from attention.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slog towards riding a bike on my 100th birthday: Eat mostly plants. Exercise regularly. Think decades, not days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md#review-every-day&quot;&gt;Review/update this list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;review-every-month&quot;&gt;Review Every Month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I’d like to check in on the 1st of every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review the Lexicon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review my Beliefs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review my Personal Canon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write a new Monthly Report and share&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review/update this list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;review-every-year&quot;&gt;Review Every Year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I’ve learned and want to remind myself of every year on my birthday (May 28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review my Monthly Reports from the year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review my Yearly Reviews&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write a new Yearly Review and share&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review/update this list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version of this Codex is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md&quot;&gt;available on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah. Life is good. 38 is good. Looking forward to more quality timez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@buster%20Hi!%20&quot;&gt;Say hi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The concept of a person is arguably the most important interface ever developed.”&lt;/strong&gt;  —  a key line in &lt;a href=&quot;http://kevinsimler.quora.com/UX-and-the-Civilizing-Process&quot;&gt;an amazing post&lt;/a&gt; by Kevin Simler about etiquette and design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-concept-of-a-person&quot;&gt;What is the concept of a person?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until reading the sentence above by Kevin, I wasn’t even aware of the fact that “the concept of a person” was a thing, much less an interface, and of course I had never considered that it might be the most important interface. But as soon as I read it, it resonated with me — it felt true, or at least it felt worthy of further consideration. It seemed important, too. Truth is, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it for the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than attempt to dissect the whole thought at once, I broke it up into pieces. Are concepts interfaces? How do interfaces become important? How is the concept of a person different from other concepts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-concepts-interfaces&quot;&gt;Are concepts interfaces?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the concept of a car. Q. What is a car? A. Well, it’s a large mechanical structure about the size of an elephant, with wheels, that people can get in and which one person drives in order to transport people and things from place to place. The concept of a car is basically a manual that surfaces the most relevant information to an assumed audience/user of the concept. In that sense, yes, a concept is an interface: it tell us how to interact with it both by including it in other concepts and by acting on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept described above is tailored to people who are new to cars. There is actually a web of car-concepts/interfaces, nested within one another, that can shift based on the direction you look at it and the kind of person who is doing the looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to think of a car. How to drive a car. How to build a car.&lt;/em&gt; Each of these concepts increases in detail as the audience is required to know more in order to master the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to be a safe driver. How to drive in a way that maximizes the longevity of your car. How to fix a car.&lt;/em&gt; These concepts are more about how optimize the driving / ownership of a car so that both you and the car avoid damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these concepts comes with an oversimplification of the physical, mechanical object that they are related to. You don’t need to know about how engines work, or combustion, or the physics of momentum, or even all the things that you don’t even know you don’t need to know about. A car (to us) is not a bundle of wires, metal, rubber, and gears… it’s something you hire in order to get a job done. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.&lt;/strong&gt; Does this all apply to the concept of a person too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to think of a person. How to be in a relationship with a person. How to create a new person. How to be safe. How to live in a way that increases your likelihood of a long life. How to recover from illness and injury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the twist that makes the concept of a person more important than most concepts is that it also provides the framework for how we understand ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-concepts-and-interfaces-become-important&quot;&gt;How do concepts and interfaces become important?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we didn’t have a concept of a person, we wouldn’t have a concept of the self (which seems pretty important).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greatest benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;because we have a “concept of a person”, we are able to interact with our own minds and bodies without having to understand everything about how or brains and bodies work.&lt;/em&gt; We can have relationships with other people without having to know everything about them, and we can find ways to live healthier, longer, and more happily without knowing exactly why everything works the way it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems like a fairly important achievement of our brains to come up with an interface to understand ourselves, and learn more about ourselves, despite very limited amounts of information. This mental model can be formed before we even have words to describe the concepts and interfaces that they enable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-is-the-concept-of-a-person-different-from-other-concepts&quot;&gt;How is the concept of a person different from other concepts?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All concepts and interfaces are designed for a specific audience, and in the case of the concept of a person, our primary audience is ourselves. We use our own understanding of how our brains work, how we optimize our success in the world, etc to not only function on a daily basis (pretty important) but also since it is a person that is having these concepts and action on them, we use this concept as a foundation to build all of our other concepts on top of (also important). For example, in order to know how to drive a car, we also need to build in considerations for the people who are driving, their abilities, their blind spots, etc. And when we ourselves are learning how to drive a car, we use the same models to estimate our own abilities, or own fears, our own strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-does-our-concept-change&quot;&gt;When does our concept change?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A concept is just a best guess mental model built from limited information. Therefore, it is bound to need correction as new information comes in. But because this concept is so foundational and intertwined with our other concepts, it tends to prefer to remain static.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What often happens is that stale parts of the concept (ie. “people who don’t like The Cure are idiots”, something I strongly believed in junior high school but have since revived, even though they are a great band) linger for longer than necessary because it’s easier to keep something that’s relatively obscure and harmless than to remove it and rewire all those neurons. Eventually, some start causing trouble (racial prejudices, sexism, homophobia, for example) and we can either dig our heels in and stubbornly refuse to change our concepts, or we can take a hit and start refactoring some of the concepts to work better with the new information. The latter is painful in the short term but beneficial in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of my concept of a person is that I think it’s easier to do this refactoring when you’re young, or in the habit of frequently consuming a lot of new information and integrating it in. And that it’s more difficult to do this as we get older, our brains are less malleable, and new things don’t arrive at the same rate (or urgency) that they used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; Always be updating your concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Smarter than smart</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2014/02/17/smarter-than-smart"/>
   <updated>2014-02-17T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2014/02/17/smarter-than-smart</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are 2 ways to be “smart”, and one way is better than the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart Version 1: Know the answer to question X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart Version 2: Know how to find the answer to question X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone were to build 2 giant computers, one that was Smart Version 1 (SV1) and one that was Smart Version 2 (SV2), what differences would they have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer 1 (C1) would need a database of answers to all questions X. For every question it received, it would parse it, interpret it, look up the corresponding answer, and return the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer 2 (C2) would need a set of programs that could answer all questions X. For every question it received it would need to parse it, interpret it, look up the corresponding program that can answer that type of question, run the program, get the answer, and return the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subtle difference but important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of C2 over C1 is that the there are probably fewer answer-finding programs required than answers. So the step where the look up happens would probably require many orders of magnitude fewer rows of information to look through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the downside of C2 is that getting the answer would be much slower, since it would require a program to be run… and so far we haven’t promised any minimum amount of time that the program can run before it needs to return an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now switching from computers to humans, when we think about our education system and the skills that we are given during our schooling years, are they training us to be humans that know all of the answers to question X (H1), or humans that know how to find the answers to all questions X (H2)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the kind of people who succeed at school/college/academics? Think about the kind of people we look for when hiring. What kind of questions do we ask in the SAT? What kind of questions do we ask in interviews?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Testing for existing knowledge is a lot easier than testing for answer-finding programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the difference in strategy between becoming an H1 versus an H2?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becoming an H1 requires training to store a large set of data. Answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becoming an H2 requires being willing to forget answers and to instead work towards general strategies for finding answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they are actually two very different learning strategies, and that given our minimal short and long term memory capacities and time spent in education, you can’t hedge your bets and do both… you have to pick a side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses have developed their own versions of becoming smart. Some are H1 methods, some are H2 methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolution is a version of C2 and H2. It has no ability to store answers to questions, but has developed a system of solving problems through programs (natural selection) that is way more efficient than C1/H1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the processes that support H1 versus the process that support H2?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H1 processes:&lt;/strong&gt; experiment data, user research data, market research data, highly qualified and experienced people who have been thinking about your problem area for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H2 processes:&lt;/strong&gt; state your core problem and the desires it fulfills, find people who have the desire/problem, propose solutions, get feedback on the solutions, build better solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H1 requires building a catalog of answers. H2 requires running a process. I strongly believe that H2 is more efficient, and less likely to become outdated, than H1. H1 is faster and has better short-term ROI than H2, but H2 is better in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;h2s-strategy-in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;H2’s strategy in a nutshell:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define the problem in terms of desires that are currently unfulfilled&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Propose a variety of solutions to fill unfulfilled desire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gather feedback from people who have unfulfilled desires on whether or not the proposed solution helps them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If desire fulfilled, go to step 5, else go to step 2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Market your proposed solution to people who have unfulfilled desires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, H2’s strategy doesn’t actually require answers to any questions. It only requires quick feedback loops between people who have a problem and possible solutions to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, natural selection doesn’t require answers. A specific species doesn’t need to know how to survive, they simply need to have quick enough reproduction cycles and sufficient mutation between generations to find a solution to an environment’s changed circumstances before they run out of the ability to generate answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural selection is a program that, evolutionarily-speaking, has solved enough questions on our planet to lead to a species of animals that can understand the program that ran to generate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls optimal H2 strategy “optionality” and “antifragility”. The ability to execute a simple program (mutate, gather feedback, select best, repeat) that is optimized at finding a solution before options run out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr;&lt;/strong&gt; The best way to be smarter than smart is to have a set of antifragile programs (mutate, gather feedback, select best, repeat) instead of trying to store objective solutions to future problems. In other words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;SV2 and C2 and H2 &amp;gt; SV1 and C1 and H1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be smarter than smart, let go of specific answers and embrace answer finding programs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2013-09-23T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/09/23/make-your-own-horse-ebooks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/horse_ebooks&quot;&gt;@horse_ebooks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/09/horse-ebooks-and-pronunciation-book-revealed.html&quot;&gt;sorta died&lt;/a&gt;. Long live @horse_ebooks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember playing around with Markov chains back in the day, and thought that it would be fun to see what that looked like when fed all 15,000 of my Tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just downloaded my 15k tweet archive, stripped links, and ran a Markov chain engine over them. About 10 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Buster (@buster) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/buster/statuses/382697401313525760&quot;&gt;September 25, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do Markov chains work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are pretty neat. There are a couple different ways to do them, but the general idea is that they take some corpus of text and keep track of how often various words appear before and after each other. Using some amount of randomness they then construct sentences based on these percentages that have most likely never been put together before, but, in some strange alternate grammatical universe, &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have been put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result? Frankensentences that have a bit of the personality of the original text, but often in sort of ridiculous new configurations. Pretty funny (to me at least).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death of loved ones can change the size of a cat named Stoli for 10.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; buster ebooks (@buster_ebooks) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/buster_ebooks/statuses/382648190358417408&quot;&gt;September 24, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/buster_ebooks&quot;&gt;many more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple people asked for how this is done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/buster&quot;&gt;@buster&lt;/a&gt; is the source available?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Paul Betts (@paulcbetts) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paulcbetts/statuses/382698358206255104&quot;&gt;September 25, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I posted the (relatively disorganized but hopefully comprehensible) code here:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Managing my internet rage</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/08/28/managing-my-internet-rage"/>
   <updated>2013-08-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/08/28/managing-my-internet-rage</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-identify-the-rage&quot;&gt;STEP 1: Identify the rage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you find yourself ENRAGED ON THE INTERNET, ask yourself these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does this person or organization or whatever make money off getting peoples’ attention?&lt;/strong&gt; (This includes celebrities, television shows, media publishers, and pretty much everyone that makes money from showing you advertisements.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so, there’s a fairly high chance that you are being PUNK’D. Meaning. They are deliberately TRYING to get a reaction out of you. The angrier you get, the louder you shout about how angry you are, the farther their message goes, the higher their ratings, the more ads they sell, the more of your SOUL they capture. And what do you get in return? The endorphin rush of anger, and a world where people are encouraged to make you even angrier next time. (How are the VMAs gonna top this year’s ratings next year? Wait and find out…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOOK. It’s okay to be angry. But why give them the satisfaction of falling into their psychological trap? Why not, rather than give them exactly what they want, think of a way to get what YOU want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this describes your rage correctly, go to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;STEP 2&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Otherwise, continue on to the next question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has this person or organization changed something that you love?&lt;/strong&gt; (This means that a certain part of your day that you typically go to for comfort, reassurance, anti-&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fomo&quot;&gt;FOMO&lt;/a&gt; protection, or other habitual impulse has been changed and your routine is THROWN OFF COURSE by a change that they didn’t consult you about.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, first, read this top 3 article explaining the Internet and how it works: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html&quot;&gt;Why Wasn’t I Consulted? (WWIC for short)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After you’re done, go to STEP 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has someone said something that you believe conflicts directly with your value system?&lt;/strong&gt; There are two versions of this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They actually do conflict with your value system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They said something that sounds like it conflicts directly with your value system but they most likely miscommunicated something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If it’s #2, then let it drop. Do not pass go. Close your browser/phone and give yourself a time out until the rage has subsided.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If it’s #1, read this XKCD comic immediately and then proceed to STEP 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/386/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-talk-to-the-rage&quot;&gt;STEP 2: Talk to the rage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you’re enraged, yes? Really angry. ANGRY!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you PILE ON with your enraged brethren and sistren with quick-witted bullet-proof self-righteousness somewhere on the Internet, ask yourself this question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which of my deeply held beliefs has been violated?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it. Our anger generally comes from a place of injustice. And our sense of injustice generally comes from our (usually unexamined) beliefs about HOW THE WORLD SHOULD WORK. Whoever angered you is violating one of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I track my &lt;a href=&quot;/beliefs&quot;&gt;beliefs&lt;/a&gt;, and update it whenever I get enraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innocent children murdered by crazed gun-totting teen?&lt;/strong&gt; Update the Beliefs File on my strongly held beliefs around gun control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrities popularize a false connection between vaccinations and autism and cause measles outbreaks to break recent records?&lt;/strong&gt; Update the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The NSA gets caught stealing our private records?&lt;/strong&gt; Update the file on my beliefs around privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sometimes I realize that whatever I’m angry about doesn’t actually violate any of my strongly held beliefs, and I was really just using it as an outlet of otherwise pent up emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-learn-something-about-yourself&quot;&gt;STEP 3: Learn something about yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall effect is that rather than react emotionally in a rather crude and impulsive way that I might later regret, I use my anger as a chance to reflect on my true beliefs (often times realizing what they are for the first time!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learn something about myself, and also, because beliefs are actionable, I end up feeling MOTIVATED TO ACT instead of just impotently ENRAGED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have one less enraged tweet to look back on in a couple years and cringe at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Win. Win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this mesh with your own deeply held beliefs about all that is wrong in the world? Hopefully it doesn’t make you too ANGRY.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-what-is-antifragility&quot;&gt;#1 What is antifragility?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a fan of Nassim Nicholas Taleb since reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness&quot;&gt;Fooled By Randomness&lt;/a&gt; 9 years ago. It’s one of those books that you read and you can never look at the world the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then he’s continued to think about the same ideas, and it’s been fascinating to follow. He really hit it out of the park with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile:_Things_That_Gain_from_Disorder&quot;&gt;Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, antifragile things are things that benefit from disorder, obstacles, unexpected events, change, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Obi-Wan: “If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The mythical Hydra, that grows two new heads every time you cut one off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“What doesn’t kill you will only make you stronger.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Natural selection, survival of the fittest, where the weak or unadapted perish, leaving the fit to continue on more suited to the environment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Silicon Valley — lots of small startups that are allowed to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Muscles get stronger when they’re pushed to the point of failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being antifragile is different from being resilient or robust. Being resilient or robust means that you bounce back quickly from disturbances — for example, a bridge that can withstand a 9.0 earthquake, or our skin that can quickly repair itself of cuts and bruises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antifragility goes a step further and describes things that not only bounce back quickly, but come back stronger when they meet adversity. The way bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics, or the way Venture Capitalists learn from the investments that fail and make smarter investments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everything in the universe that has lasted a significant portion of time has an antifragile system in place. This is simply because the fragile things (things that could not withstand high levels of change and adversity) and even the resilient things have been eliminated over the years as the universe changed around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-chaos-monkey&quot;&gt;#2 The Chaos Monkey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re familiar with Netflix’s Chaos Monkey, skip to &lt;strong&gt;#3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix has a server architecture that currently serves a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57546405-93/netflix-gobbles-a-third-of-peak-internet-traffic-in-north-america/&quot;&gt;pretty high percentage&lt;/a&gt; of all of the internet’s traffic, due to their streaming video service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting things about their server architecture is that they routinely attack their own systems. They have a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html&quot;&gt;Chaos Monkey&lt;/a&gt; that randomly disables their own production instances to make sure they can survive that common type of failure without any customer impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there are several ways in which servers can fail, they’ve also employed a fleet of monkeys that attack all manner of servers — some that are too slow, some that aren’t connected up to the proper server groups, some that just look weird, etc. And finally, there’s a Chaos Gorilla that doesn’t just turn off individual servers, but occasionally wipes out an entire availability zone, as if Godzilla had destroyed an entire portion of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophy is simple: by building a server architecture that expects failure, the system as a whole can learn how to withstand bigger and tougher obstacles even if they don’t know exactly when or how they will occur in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-lifes-chaos-monkey&quot;&gt;#3 Life’s Chaos Monkey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/live-like-a-hydra-2-1242x976.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chaos Monkey&quot; caption=&quot;Chaos Monkey&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/live-like-a-hydra-2-1242x976.jpg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/live-like-a-hydra-2-1242x976.jpg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/live-like-a-hydra-2-1242x976.jpg 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about goals (43things.com) and habits (healthmonth.com, 750words.com, 8:36pm) over the years, and I’ve long believed that the only way to change anything about your life is to guard against failure. Now I realize it’s more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goals and habits, as they are represented in mainstream culture, are very fragile things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals, habits, and resolutions are often crafted with ambitious expectations that are then susceptible to the first rainy day, sick day, vacation day, holiday, grumpy day, low-energy day, or otherwise non-standard day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most goals and habits try to ignore the fact that chance occurrences will disturb their best laid plans. And by trying to ignore this random factor, they become &lt;em&gt;extremely vulnerable to them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life’s Chaos Monkey has become very skilled at tripping up the best intentioned goal-maker or habit-maker. Ask anyone. Ask yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why almost all products and services that claim to be able to change you say that it only takes 21 days, or 30 days, or 90 days to change. The chance of a Chaos Monkey throwing a banana onto your path is smaller if you keep the time period low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be able to exercise regularly for 21 days, or even 90 days, but more often than not this is because the Chaos Monkey was on vacation, or just bugging someone else (he’s a busy dude).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, he will show up. And you need to not only be ready for him, but welcome his wily antics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-love-the-chaos-monkey&quot;&gt;#4 Love the Chaos Monkey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been pretty sick for the last 4 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My meditation habit and biking habit are totally offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serving lots of Fail Whale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is that I’ve learned to love the Chaos Monkey, and rather than try to stay on a single track with my goals and habits all the time, I have a list of modes that I can switch to in response to my current mental and physical states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix’s servers probably don’t get super frustrated every time the Chaos Monkey strikes. Rather, because it’s expected (self-inflicted even), they become an opportunity to test, refine, and improve the recovery systems. Taking certain servers offline isn’t going to break their streak, or prove that they’re worthless as servers. Shifting gears and responding to the adversity is just a necessary step in order to recover faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chaos Monkey is actually here to help you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chaos Monkey is here to help you practice switching gears, help you build antifragile responses, help you get stronger and smarter about your life, so that you survive even bigger monkeys in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to meditate and take long bike rides during this health outage, for the last 4 days I’m all about taking walks, sitting in the sun, listening to audiobooks, and writing long posts on Medium (hi!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were on a bike, being sick would be like hitting a steep hill. The way to get up the hill is to shift to a lower gear. Once I’m on flatter ground again, I can shift back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-an-antifragile-way-of-life&quot;&gt;#5 An antifragile way of life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An antifragile way of life is all about finding a way to gain from the inevitable disorder of life. To not only bounce back when things don’t go as planned, but to get stronger, smarter, and better at continuing as a result of running into this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, here are some principles that come from Antifragile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stick to simple rules&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build in redundancy and layers (no single point of failure)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resist the urge to suppress randomness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure that you have your soul in the game&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experiment and tinker — take lots of small risks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid risks that, if lost, would wipe you out completely&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t get consumed by data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep your options open&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus more on avoiding things that don’t work than trying to find out what does work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Respect the old — look for habits and rules that have been around for a long time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general underlying principle here is to play the long game, keep your options open and avoid total failure while trying lots of different things and maintaining an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that don’t fit into these principles (that you’re probably more familiar with):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Giving something up cold turkey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going all in with a single big change for a short period of time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tracking everything&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using the latest and greatest gadgets and apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-seven-modes-for-seven-heads&quot;&gt;#6 Seven modes (for seven heads)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything in the universe goes through cycles. Cycles of high energy and low energy. Cycles of change and stability. Cycles of focus and distraction. We’re no different, but most of the time we are trying to force fit ourselves into a mode that we aren’t in, and that causes trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are seven modes that I think capture a good chunk of my own day to day states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recovery Mode.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the mode where we are burned out, tired, over-stimulated, under-nourished, and basically useless. This Chaos Monkey has hit us and we are down. The goal of this mode is to get out of it. The way to get out of it is to focus on the basics: sleep, water, sunshine, vegetables, exercise, stretching, meditation, nature, comfort of friends, walks, and good books and other entertainment. Trying to be productive is pointless. Productivity happens in other modes… so work on moving out of this mode, slowly, patiently, without beating yourself up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novelty Mode.&lt;/strong&gt; This mode has a slightly higher energy level than Recovery Mode but not quite enough energy to focus on a specific thing. The key here is to channel the desire for distraction into seeking novelty. Meeting new people, trying new restaurants, going new places, learning about something new. It’s also a great place to think about the people that are important to you, reaching out to important people that you haven’t connected with in a while, restarting hobbies that have fallen by the wayside, and revisiting things that you don’t like to see if maybe there’s something new there that changes things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Mode.&lt;/strong&gt; This mode is about the same energy level as Novelty Mode but is handy when there’s a big backlog of things that need to get done that have been weighing on you. Things that don’t require much creativity or thought to do, but which just need to be banged out. Fixing things, cleaning things, maintaining things, organizing things, etc. When done in the right mode, this kind of slogging work can actually be very satisfying.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self Mode.&lt;/strong&gt; This mode is all about reconnecting with yourself. Making sure that you know what your needs are, and are able to take the steps to make sure that they’re met. This mode benefits from the progress of having your basics covered (sleep, nutrition, exercise) as well as having some outlet for the crazy energy that can only be taken care of by exploration and grunt work. Once in this mode, you’re ready to calm down, think about your values and beliefs, think about your interests and important people, and make decisions that are in your best long-term interest even if they’re difficult in the short term. Get your own head screwed on right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flow Mode.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a higher energy mode than Novelty, Work, and Self Mode, and requires that you’ve got at least one known interest that you’re ready to pour your soul into. A life project. It takes a lot of energy and time to get into the flow and have quality time with a deep interest, but once there it is one of the most fulfilling modes to be in. Put in quality time towards something bigger than you, something you love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Mode.&lt;/strong&gt; Quality time with people you love is probably the most rewarding experience we can have on this planet. The list is short of people that fit this category, and these are the people that are most easy to take for granted. Also, some relationships might need repair or re-connection before quality time is possible. Being in this mode is all about doing the work that sets you up for quality time, and making sure you have a chance to connect in a real way with the people that mean the most to you, as often as possible, while we can. Life is long, but not forever long.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gold Mode.&lt;/strong&gt; This mode is much like Recovery Mode, except where your beliefs, relationships, interests, work, and sense of self are all lined up and working together. Where the first six modes require energy, this mythical seventh mode floats above them all. Honestly, I don’t know much about this mode, and have only experienced it in short bursts of tranquility, but I keep it here as a landmark for a way of living that is proactive, whole-hearted, and utterly unconflicted for sustained periods of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of these modes is to offer a selection of alternatives when one strategy isn’t working. Rather than beating my head against the wall because I’m trying to be social when I’d rather just organize my finances, these modes allow me to switch to the circumstances, and be productive within the mode that I’m currently in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re feeling stuck, switch modes. Try another head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-how-to-be-a-hydra&quot;&gt;#7 How to be a Hydra&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a Hydra is all about the long term. Thinking, even, about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/better-humans/20cc8d9c7494&quot;&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, and the things that you’d look back on while you laid in your death bed as worth doing. Maximizing your life, today, to be reflected on positively from your death bed. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@buster/if-i-lived-100-times-806222d3d4e?source=linkShare-5142451174a3-1515774049&quot;&gt;If I Live 100 Times&lt;/a&gt;, for a morbid exploration of that thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, maximize the life we have. How?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think on the scale of months and years and decades (not hours, days, weeks).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think in terms of quality time with the people you love, passionate projects that you can pour your soul into, and your core beliefs (not day-to-day grievances, individual tasks, or short-lived challenges).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;follow-simple-rules-create-redundant-systems&quot;&gt;Follow simple rules. Create redundant systems.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set a reminder on your phone, in your calendar, as a post-it note on your bathroom mirror, to remember the 1st of every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 1st day of every month is your chance to re-start, revise, and recommit to the things that are most important to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a document on your computer, phone, or in a notebook titled something like &lt;strong&gt;“Review Every Month”&lt;/strong&gt; and create sections for “My Goals”, “My Interests”, “My People”, “My Beliefs”, and “Chaos Monkey Tricks”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;See my doc as an example: &lt;a href=&quot;/codex&quot;&gt;Book of Beliefs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 1st day of the month, every month, open your “Review Every Month” document:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check in for last month.&lt;/strong&gt; If you had a goal for last month, write “HIT” or “MISS” next to it, depending on if you think you did or did not meet the purpose of the goal. “MISS” is totally okay, it means you can edit the goal to be more antifragile this month. Write “PASS” next to any older goals that you hadn’t updated yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did the &lt;strong&gt;Chaos Monkey&lt;/strong&gt; get you at all last month? If so, how did you respond to it, and should you have done anything differently? Add a brief description under the “Chaos Monkey Tricks” as a record.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did your list of &lt;em&gt;interests&lt;/em&gt; that you pour your soul into change last month? Add, edit, or remove as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did your list of &lt;em&gt;important people&lt;/em&gt; change last month? Add, edit, or remove as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did your &lt;em&gt;beliefs&lt;/em&gt; change around anything? Add, edit, or remove as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sit for a second and think. Which &lt;strong&gt;mode(s)&lt;/strong&gt; are you primarily in this month? (See #6 to review modes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If in Recovery Mode or Gold Mode, no need to set a goal for this month, just come back next month. Write “PASS” for this month’s goal. It’s TOTALLY OKAY to take a few months to recover. Take them… life is long, and it’s better to recover now than to stay in a burned out state for a long period of time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If in one of the other modes, &lt;strong&gt;copy, revise, or write a new goal for the month&lt;/strong&gt;. Take into consideration the beliefs, people, and interests that support it. Also take into consideration any beliefs, people, or interests that might hinder it. Build in enough flexibility that it will be able to withstand any previous wily moves by the Chaos Monkey.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re ready to be fucking awesome this month, say “Fuck yeah!” If it’s going to a tough month but you are ready to meet it best you can, say “This is happening!” If you’re floundering, close the doc and go talk to one of your important people about it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your goal requires any further reminders or systems to work, set those up. Be aware that confusion over tools is a classic Chaos Monkey move. If there’s any possibility at all, keep it simple. Track your progress in your head or on a piece of paper.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do your thing. &lt;strong&gt;And come back next month.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all relies on returning each month, reviewing the most important things in your life (beliefs, people, interests), making note of how the Chaos Monkey is tripping you up, and making short-term goals to keep the most important things in your life front and center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The interesting paradox of this whole thing, however, is that it’s a bit of a circular dependency. The monthly review habit is itself a fragile thing. In order to make time for important things you need to already have motivation to make time for important things, because the process itself is an important thing. The meta-tip is to notice when circumstances in your life have naturally shifted to favor the important over the urgent (at the very least, Self Mode), and then that energy to set up calendars, alarms, peer pressure, and every other attention shifting tool in the world to bring you back every month. And if that doesn’t work, try again next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go long, and get stronger and smarter along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go on. Be a Chaos Monkey loving Hydra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You get one death bed point whenever you do something that you believe will still be valuable and meaningful to you when you’re on your death bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toss out your goals, toss out your desire to change. Step back for a moment with me. Believe me, it’s not easy for me to say this. I built 43things.com because I believed then that managing goals was the best way to live life. I built healthmonth.com because I believed then that answering the question “&lt;a href=&quot;http://bustr.tumblr.com/post/20775796587/how-do-we-change-ourselves&quot;&gt;How do we change ourselves?&lt;/a&gt;” was the single most important question we could ask ourselves during this life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m strongly considering an alternative to this way of thinking. Follow this train of thought with me for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-here&quot;&gt;Start here.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, you will die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your loved ones will die. Your friends, your family, everyone you know, will die. I know, nobody really appreciates when I bring this up, it’s a total buzzkill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mortigo&lt;/em&gt; is that sensation of falling that I get when I strongly consider my mortality. When I truly grasp, in the moment, that my life and everything I’ve known will blink away in a matter of decades, if not years, if not hours, and I will cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Crocker mentioned to me the other day that in his startup, Sessions, which helps people get healthy with the support of a coach, he can often tell when someone’s going to succeed if they’ve recently had a strong “mortality moment”. Either someone close to them died, or they had a close call themselves, or they recently had a child and realized that they need to stay healthy for them, etc. Without that mortality moment, many of us want to change, but don’t actually have enough reason to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These mortality moments, these moments of mortigo, are an untapped source of sustainable, renewable, long-term motivation. Can you self-induce a moment of mortigo in yourself? Right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can, consider that motivation in the context of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gaining insight into the things that are most important to you, that you want others to understand about yourself. Basically, quality alone time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spending more quality time with your favorite people. The people you live for. Who are they?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working on projects related to your deepest interests. The passions you live for. What are they?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend quality time with yourself, your favorite people, and your strongest interests. Wholeheartedly dive into these relationships and projects, and contribute your true self to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which relationships and projects are thriving?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which ones are being neglected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;top-5-regrets-of-the-dying&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying&quot;&gt;Top 5 regrets of the dying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself not the life others expected of me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish I hadn’t worked so hard.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish I’d had the courage to express my feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish I had let myself be happier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn that around and play this game, let’s call it &lt;strong&gt;the Death Bed Game”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rules-of-the-game&quot;&gt;Rules of the Game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give yourself 1 point when you do something that counter acts one of these regrets of the dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 point when you get quality alone time, diving into your own unfiltered, real self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 point when you spend quality time with your favorite people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 point when you get in the flow working on something you’re really interested in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I track them with my SMS private journal, &lt;a href=&quot;http://peabrain.co/&quot;&gt;Peabrain&lt;/a&gt;. But you could share them verbally, just think about them before bed, put them on your calendar, write them in a book, post them to Twitter or Facebook… do whatever you want that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing this for a couple weeks and I get about 5 points a week. It has shifted how I think about the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t take time to myself for granted. I don’t go to work without thinking about how I can do my most meaningful work. I don’t come home without thinking about how I can have the best quality time with my wife and son. I don’t go out with friends without thinking about how I can connect and share with them on a real level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still pretty bad at this game, though. The point of writing it out is make it a little more real to my brain. And I guess to see what others think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making goals and changing my habits might naturally emerge from the people and interests, as a way to increase the quality of my relationships and interests, but they are not the end in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My world is turned a bit upside down by this line of thinking. It might very well be obvious to everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my death bed, these are the things I imagine finding valuable and meaningful about my life. It might be different for you. Think about it, find out what those things are and consider trying to get more of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before it’s too late. Dun dun DUN.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Know Thy Umwelt</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/06/16/know-thy-umwelt"/>
   <updated>2013-06-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/06/16/know-thy-umwelt</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rambling notes on a Sunday afternoon after a sunny bike ride.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/buster_24685687876608_small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Neocortex&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our brains have roughly one hundred billion (100,000,000,000) neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About thirty billion of them 30,000,000,000 belong in our neocortex, the part of our brain that’s unique to mammals, and that are responsible for our ability to recognize, remember, and predict patterns in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single pattern recognizer in the brain is hypothesized by Ray Kurzweil to be  made up of about 100 neurons, which means we have the potential to store roughly three hundred million 300,000,000 patterns in our brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pattern could be something very low level (for example, a pattern that can detect edges), mid-level (a pattern that can detect words), or high level (a pattern that can detect meaning). There are a lot more levels than that obviously, but the interesting thing is that each level is a new pattern made out of simpler patterns below. Edges turn into lines, lines turn into letters, letters turn into words, words turn into meanings, meanings turn into beliefs, beliefs turn into identities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could say that we each carry around in our brains a representation of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Brain—is wider than the Sky—
For—put them side by side—
The one the other will contain
With ease—and You—beside—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Brain is deeper than the sea—
For—hold them—Blue to Blue—
The one the other will absorb—
As Sponges—Buckets—do—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Brain is just the weight of God—
For—Heft them—Pound for Pound—
And they will differ—if they do—
As Syllable from Sound—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Emily Dickenson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The universe in our brains, however, has a few striking differences than the actual universe outside of our brain. The most obvious difference being that the universe in our brain only requires (at most) fourteen million gigabytes (14 petabytes) to store, whereas the real universe is of course much larger (and includes our brains and the representations of itself in them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This universe in our brain, the full set of patterns, meanings, symbols, histories, stories, and predictions, is referred to by some as our &lt;em&gt;umwelt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our umwelt is our internal model of the universe. When we are born, our umwelt doesn’t include much more than the smell of our mother, light and dark, heart beats, and whatever music our parents were listening to when we were in utero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we start to understand how we are separate from our parents, and behave independently of one another, the umwelt shifts to allow for such an understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see the sun for the first time, a sun gets added to our umwelt and we learn how to recognize it, correlate it with other patterns we already know (light, warmth, day, outside, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we learn our first words, the notion of sound patterns being correlated with objects and emotions gets added to our umwelt. Those words then get used to recognize other patterns, and to more quickly absorb data from the outside world that is only encoded in words (written and spoken).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of our umwelts are a unique interpretation and model of the universe. There are seven billion (7,000,000,000) human umwelts on the planet, seven billion models of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spend a lot of time under the assumption that my umwelt is the same as yours. A good chunk of our umwelt is cordoned off as “common sense” be it the differences between day and night, or how to use an iPad, or proper table manners. Much of “growing up” is about creating an umwelt that can consistently predict how other umwelts will react in different circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our umwelt, patterns are lists of other patterns, and are indistinguishable from memories and stories. Each of these things has some of the following qualities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are a list of other patterns, stories, and memories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When triggered, they increase the likelihood of other patterns, stories, and memories from occurring next, while also decreasing the likelihood of other patterns, stories, and memories.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They occur in a sequence, and can only be reversed by replaying the same sequence over and over, stopping at earlier points each time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We cannot stop patterns, stories, and memories from occurring once they’ve been triggered. We can only try to smash them with other patterns, stories, and memories.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patterns, stories, and memories are sequenced patterns that help us better predict the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each time a pattern, story, or memory gets triggered, it changes the patterns, stories, and memories that triggered it… either strengthening the bond or weakening it (depending on how useful it is in the current situation to predict the next pattern in the line).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because our umwelts are much smaller than the universe they are designed to model, I wonder if it’s more accurate to think of it as a cartoon of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the data in the universe is invisible to us. Of the tiny tiny fraction that reaches us in some way or another, even that has to be sifted out. Only data that will help us tell better stories, find better patterns, and create more meaning in our existing umwelt will be stored for later use.  Of everything that’s stored, only that which is repeatedly re-accessed will be retrievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What remains is a poorly drawn stick-figure drawing of the universe in our minds. Which is, to us, dazzling in its complexity, delightful in its intricacy, wonderous in its expansiveness. A poorly drawn stick-figure, but the only one we will ever know.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Experimenting with subjectivity</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/06/05/experimenting-with-subjectivity"/>
   <updated>2013-06-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/06/05/experimenting-with-subjectivity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After going to the Quantified Self conference last month and thinking about it for a few weeks, I’ve decided to start a new self-tracking experiment… or rather to adapt my existing one to new thoughts on what’s worth tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, tonight I made a list of my four top interests, and I made a list of the four people that matter most to me in the world. “Quality time” with these interests and people is what I plan to track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a new spreadsheet with a column for each interest and each person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put “6/4/2013” in the first available row, and for the cells that corresponded to interest columns I asked myself, “Did I spent any quality time focused on this interest today?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave myself a zero if I didn’t. I gave myself a one if I spent time but didn’t feel like it was very high quality. And I gave myself a two if I spent at least some high quality time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the same thing for people. “Did I spent any quality time with this person today?” I gave myself a zero if I didn’t. I gave myself a one if I spent time but didn’t feel like it was very high quality. And I gave myself a two if I spent at least some high quality time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I created a column that had me subjectively rate the day between -2 (toss it in the bin), and 2 (let’s have more of these). I am going to try to use it as a gut check that can verify that there is correlation between my overall day and the quality time I spend with my closest people and top interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, a column that totals up the sum of the scores in a crude way, and color codes it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and a daily alarm on my phone for 10:59am to “be subjective”. Realistically, this is the only way it ever gets done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked in the past about a different spreadsheet that attempted to correlated objective data (sleep, alcohol, diet, weight, various habits, etc) to the subjective measure of the day. The end result of that experiment was that quality time with Kellianne and Niko, along with “meaningful work” were the only numbers that had any statistical correlation with the quality of my day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new spreadsheet is an evolution of the idea that it’s quality time with people and interests that ultimately has the highest correlation with a fulfilled day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It currently looks something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/buster_24667507857582_retina.png&quot; alt=&quot;Be subjective&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just another experimental step on the long road to trying to figure out what #quantifiedself means to me, what self-tracking means to me, and what it is gonna take to get to the bottom of my own sense of fulfillment in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carry on.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2013-05-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/05/28/more-kiloslogs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every year of my 30s has had some kind of birthday reflection and a motto. Here are the ones from the past:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/05-28-talk-it-out&quot;&gt;36: Talk it out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really impressed with my coworker Kevin Weil who ran 30 miles on his 30th birthday this last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE. 32.1 miles. Beautiful day and wonderful company with @&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elizabeth&quot;&gt;elizabeth&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adrianfenty&quot;&gt;adrianfenty&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cleanbottle&quot;&gt;cleanbottle&lt;/a&gt; @&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/morgenfeld&quot;&gt;morgenfeld&lt;/a&gt;. Feels good to be (almost) 30.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kevin Weil (@kevinweil) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kevinweil/status/338755373576093696&quot;&gt;May 26, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; run 37 miles today. I wonder actually if there was ever a year that I could run the number of miles that matched my age.  I think 17 or 18 was probably my best bet, but that’s pretty lame… if I can get back on my running wagon maybe I could aspire to run 40 miles on my 40th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary personal goal this year is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://buster.svbtle.com/1000-small-things&quot;&gt;do 1,000 small things to become a marathoner&lt;/a&gt;. I registered for the Lake Tahoe marathon at the end of September. My knee is attempting to thwart me, but I am not gonna let that discourage me (too much).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;updated-manifesto-for-living&quot;&gt;Updated Manifesto for Living&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also take the time every year to update my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Manifesto.md&quot;&gt;Manifesto for Living&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must not dilly-dally&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be your word&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must have good intentions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must admit to being the maker of meaning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must not feel sorry for yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must have a vision that you are striving for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must tie creativity and experimentation with survival&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be the change you want to see&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must rally others with your vision&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must stake your reputation on your better self&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be comfortable with the consequences of being who you are&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must share&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must make your own advice and take it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must manage your stress, health, and clarity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must study your mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must retry things you don’t like every once in a while&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must go slow, work hard, and avoid shortcuts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must know what you really believe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must make time to enjoy things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hasn’t changed drastically since 2007, but it has grown from 11 to 19 and probably needs to be edited down again sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;updated-beliefs-file&quot;&gt;Updated beliefs file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as of this last year, I’ve also started maintaining my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Beliefs.md&quot;&gt;list of beliefs&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/commits/master/Beliefs.md&quot;&gt;public history of changes&lt;/a&gt; as they evolve. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://buster.svbtle.com/codex-vitae&quot;&gt;see inspiration here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Beliefs.md&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/buster_24654376435878_small.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beliefs file&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do all of this?  I’ve found that as I get older, I often forget things that were important to me in the past. By documenting these things, it’s possible to build on a foundation that’s too difficult to keep in my working memory all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this strange hope that one day all of these various beliefs, values, mottos, etc will coalesce into some simple unified understanding about life. But I’m not holding my breath right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our brains evolved to strive for a coherent narrative (as a way to predict long-term dangers with more accuracy than a non-narrative-driven logic could capture). We strive for a single driving plot line that explains all of the myriad convoluting details. But a coherent narrative isn’t a naturally occuring thing, and in a way the tension between real life and coherent narratives creates as exhaust an unending supply of frustrating cognitive dissonance that might be a big chunk of our motivation to get out of bed in the morning. To make things make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-years-motto&quot;&gt;This year’s motto:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More kiloslogs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My made up word’s definition:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 unit of work towards a long-term meaningful shift in identity is a “slog”. 1,000 slogs towards the same long-term meaningful shift in identity is a “kiloslog”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot about my death bed this year. From creating my own memento mori to reflect on every day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.haikudeck.com/e/u9qVHcR7Ts&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To thinking about how I would die &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/self-knowledge-through-numbers/806222d3d4e&quot;&gt;if I lived 100 times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/self-knowledge-through-numbers/806222d3d4e&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/buster_24654294509346_small.png&quot; alt=&quot;png.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To calculating &lt;a href=&quot;http://buster.svbtle.com/deathday&quot;&gt;my deathday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite my morbid tendencies, the goal of the thought train is to continue to reset my perspective on life so as to minimize regret on my death bed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think about the things I will regret on my deathbed, the general character of “regretted things” are things like missed opportunities, an insistence on holding on to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.90percentofeverything.com/2011/01/06/local-maxima-and-the-perils-of-data-driven-design/&quot;&gt;local maxima&lt;/a&gt;, and a general lack of purpose that results in years or decades of long circuitous routes back to where I started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unit of work that leads to “appreciated things” on my death bed seems to be clumps of work that had some artful or meaningful result. For some reason I imagine that the resolution is a minimum of 2-4 years of intentional, focused effort. Approximately a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/better-humans/52167e196771&quot;&gt;metric kiloslog&lt;/a&gt; of meaningful work towards something bigger than myself.  Life only has enough room for a dozen-ish kiloslogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to focus this year on making more of those. More kiloslogs in year 37!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically speaking, initially I used Twitter to track each of the slogs towards becoming a marathoner, but usage dropped off when the novelty of the work wore off. I didn’t want to tweet every little thing I did. So I’ve recently switched to using &lt;a href=&quot;http://peabrain.co&quot;&gt;Peabrain&lt;/a&gt; to track my slog-tracking, and hope that my velocity starts to pick up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://peabrain.co&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/buster_24654699857880_small.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kiloslog on Peabrain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently 49/1,000 slogs into my journey towards becoming a marathoner. Which, I think, might be at least one of the things I appreciate having done on my death bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS. What’s the character of things you’ll regret and things you’ll appreciate on your death bed?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Celebrate your next death day</title>

   <updated>2013-05-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/05/17/celebrate-your-next-death-day</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Your birthday is the number of years you’ve been alive (obviously).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if we also celebrated the number of years we estimate to have left?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a quick script to calculate your next deathday (when your years remaining hits a round number).  Because your years remaining go down a little slower than your years so far, presuming you don’t die, it’s going to be different every year. The data comes from the CDC’s latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm&quot;&gt;death report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want me to tell you what your next deathday is, just tweet me your birthday (you have to include the year, month, and day) by replying to the tweet below. I’ll try to respond to most within the next day or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to my deathday script, today is my 43rd deathday (meaning I have exactly 43 years of life expectancy left). &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/R4dDoMo7PJ&quot;&gt;http://t.co/R4dDoMo7PJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Buster (@buster) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/buster/statuses/423507651981344768&quot;&gt;January 15, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>If I lived 100 times</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/05/04/if-i-lived-100-times"/>
   <updated>2013-05-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/05/04/if-i-lived-100-times</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just did something sort of morbid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lifexpec.htm&quot;&gt;the most recent life expectancy data&lt;/a&gt; published by the CDC, I ran the numbers for my current age and gender to find the distribution of my year of death if I lived 100 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This accounts for all of the currently reported causes of deaths, ranging from all types of cancer, to suicide, to assault, to lightning strikes and car accidents, to drowning, to kidney infections and a thousand other categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there were 100 of me, all 36 years old (as I am right now), and you set them loose, one of me dies before I turn 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one of me dies before I turn 45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two more of me die before 50, another two before 55, and another two before 60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then things start to ramp up and five of me die before 65, six of me before 70, and nine of me before 75.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the one hundred Busters that started at age 36, only 59 of me make it past my 80th birthday.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixteen of me die before 85, eighteen of me before 90, and fifteen of me before 95.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my 100th birthday, seven of me got pretty close, but only two of me are left to blow out the candles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those two die within the next 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What were those last nine or ten Busters like? Were they the ones that, at age 36, were running every morning? Did they drink as much as I did last night? Or did they just get lucky?
I want to know more. What happened to the Buster that died before age 40? Was it cancer, like my father (age 41)? Was it one of me that made a poor life choice and never course corrected? Or was he just hit by a bus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My neighbor is 81 and is still in great health. I want to be one of me that is more like him when I’m 81… riding bikes, going on ski trips, gardening in the yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turn 37 at the end of the month. And my average remaining life expectancy is 45.2 years. What if we celebrated our expected years left instead of our years already spent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to run the script one more time, for a single Buster, and see what it turns up. [brb]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hm. Not good. Its answer: &lt;em&gt;“1 Buster dies before age 50”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing personal about this data. I have some time to fiddle with the odds, some natural advantages and disadvantages, etc. It would be interesting to look at likely causes of death, for example, and at forecasting outcomes for my wife and I together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more thorough experiment would be to take this baseline and apply some personal data (my current level of health, my current exposure to various risks) and play out another 100 Busters given different strategies (becoming vegan, running marathons, gaining 30 pounds, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll probably start playing around with this data a bit more. Let me know if you find it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>1 metric kiloslog</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/04/22/one-metric-kiloslog"/>
   <updated>2013-04-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/04/22/one-metric-kiloslog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I respect BJ Fogg and his work around &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyhabits.com/&quot;&gt;tiny habits&lt;/a&gt;, but lately I’ve found my own opinions (granted, I’m no academic) diverging from his quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my thinking about behavior change lately has ended up re-affirming my conviction that &lt;a href=&quot;http://wayoftheduck.com/huge-habits&quot;&gt;habits aren’t tiny things&lt;/a&gt;. They’re huge. If you could do a brain scan on someone and squirt food coloring into their ear that highlighted the neuronal pathways that supported, say, their exercise habit, my guess is that you’d see a complex and fragile structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people talk about tiny habits, I think they are hiding the cost of true change. It’s akin to saying something like: “You can buy a house, just put $1 down. Make sure you pay $1 a day for 21 days, and then your automatic bill pay will kick in and pay for the rest.” &lt;strong&gt;It’s not a strategy for buying a house, it’s a sales tactic for selling houses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can’t just download an app or sign up to a mailing list and have that complex brain structure magically appear in your head. &lt;strong&gt;You have to build it yourself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you’re someone that wants to start an exercise habit. How should we frame the task of constructing this complex habit structure in your brain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not about putting your shoes next to your bed. It’s not about doing something 21 days in a row. Those things will only work if you already have a complex exercise habit structure in your brain (for example, if you’d had a regular exercise habit earlier in life that later lapsed), and all you need to do is plug it back into your morning routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of us, it’s not gonna be that easy. &lt;strong&gt;It’s gonna be a long fucking slog.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think there’s a way to frame and connect small-ish changes in the context of the long slog, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently &lt;a href=&quot;http://wayoftheduck.com/1000-small-things&quot;&gt;counting down from 1,000&lt;/a&gt; in my goal to become a marathoner. After almost 2 months, I’m down to 959. Currently on pace to reach 0 by June 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples have been:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eating a salad when I didn’t want to in the moment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going on a run&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditating 7 days in a row&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading a book about running&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being sore from yesterday’s run (yes, I effectively counted that run twice)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hitting a short term weight loss goal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Registering for a run&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buying a bike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sincerely believe that &lt;a href=&quot;http://wayoftheduck.com/belief-change&quot;&gt;behavior change is identity/belief change&lt;/a&gt;. Almost every goal has an underlying identity component underneath it. The great thing about counting down from 1,000 is that I feel like I can count small things, and even things that only seem tangentially related… because they are anchored to the identity change and not the behavior change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may actually run a marathon before then (I’ve registered for the Lake Tahoe marathon this September), but the goal is not to just run a marathon, it’s to become a marathoner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;1 metric slog is a small thing you do (that doesn’t yet come naturally) that is essentially practice wearing a new identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1,000 slogs is a kiloslog. A kiloslog is my best guess for the approximate weight of a single change in behavior/identity that will stick around. Depending on how big the identity shift is, a change may weigh more or less than one kiloslog, but it’s a good starting point to aim for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If each kiloslog takes about 3 years (give or take depending on how my pace changes), we can do about 3 kiloslogs every 10 years. And maybe 15-20 kiloslogs in our lives, towing who knows how many behavior changes behind them as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose your kiloslogs wisely. Make sure that these shifts in identity are worthy of the time, energy, patience, and investment that they require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go long. Go slow. Take no shortcuts. Expect no magic. Despite the huge, heavy, complex nature of change, take it lightly. Have fun. It’s the only way you’ll stick it out to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What identity are you slogging towards? How much do you think it weighs?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Three cognitive biases walk into a bar...</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/04/07/three-cognitive-biases-walk-into-a-bar"/>
   <updated>2013-04-07T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/04/07/three-cognitive-biases-walk-into-a-bar</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most people are loss averse. Meaning that the pain of losing something is felt about twice as strongly as the pleasure of gaining something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people are also fairly bad at intuitively understanding risk.  We understand certainty (0% and 100%) but tend to get everything in between muddled up. Some people err on the downside (thinking things are less likely than they really are) and some people err on the upside (thinking things are more likely than they really are).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we combine being loss averse with also erring on risk’s downside, we will act extra conservatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are loss averse and err on the upside with risk, the two might actually manage to cancel themselves out a bit. In other words, even though we continue to be loss averse, we’re also biased to underestimate the chances of losing something and overestimate the chances of gaining something. In this case, two biases make us act, effectively, unbiased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important distinction:&lt;/strong&gt; It would be an error to label people with this double-bias as risk-tolerant. They aren’t necessarily seeing bets and making them, but rather systematically misunderstanding situations to be less risky than they really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this counter-balanced double-bias system does “work” by effectively giving us the “correct” risk analysis of multiple situations, and we notice this, then confidence in our own intuition gets ratcheted up. We believe it’s because we’re good at understanding risk, knowing when to bet and when not to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence will reduce our loss aversion, and make us double down on our intuitive understanding of risk. Thus toppling the perfectly balanced biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the biases get out of sync, our hot streak (another cognitive illusion) ends, our confidence falls, loss aversion jumps back up, and maybe we spend a cycle on the side of erring on risk’s downside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a fragile system where we occasionally reach an optimal state of counter-balanced biases that will only last as long as we don’t acknowledge it as true intuition (aka avoid the illusion of control bias).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck out there!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to change yourself (v0.1)</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/03/18/how-to-change-yourself-v1"/>
   <updated>2013-03-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/03/18/how-to-change-yourself-v1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many other ways to change, but this is the one that is my current best/favorite theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Complete the sentence: “I am an aspiring &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;.” Try to find the most succinct identity that represents the difference between who you are now and who you want to be. It doesn’t have to explain why, or how, you will get there. Just put a flag down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; I realize that this first step is not very easy to do. That’s intentional. Step #1 will require some thinking to find the right fit for your “lose 5 pounds”, “eat better”, “quit smoking”, “get in shape” goals. Think about the &lt;em&gt;kind of person you want to become&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;naturally&lt;/em&gt; weighs less, eats well, doesn’t smoke, is in shape, etc. Make sure that you really do want to be that person. Use this identity as the anchor to pull all of the entangled habits and behaviors into yourself (assume here that you’re at the bottom of the ocean and it is difficult to pull things towards you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Update your bios on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other favorite social networks with the sentence from #1. You don’t have to announce anything about it, but it needs to be somewhere that random people can see it. (This makes it feel real.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Craft another sentence describing a 1-month resolution which strategically gets you closer to #1, and has the following constraints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s only ONE resolution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Phrase it in such a way that it is either HIT or MISSED for a given month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure that it’s calibrated in such a way that if it ends up being HIT, you will be happy with yourself, and if it turns out to be MISSED for the month you’ll be unhappy with yourself. Do not make it so easy or so difficult that it’s possible to fail at the resolution while still being happy that progress has been made, or succeed at the resolution and still being unhappy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Include any footnotes you feel are necessary to say what you think “counts” and what you think “doesn’t count” for interpretations of the resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Join the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/rabbit-rabbit&quot;&gt;Rabbit Rabbit Resolution Accountability Squad&lt;/a&gt; mailing list and introduce yourself by stating the answers to #1 and #3. Feel free to ask for help clarifying or zeroing in on what you’re really interested in working on. Prepare for friendly feedback from the group, too. Comment on as many threads from other people working on resolutions as you feel comfortable. (This is your accountability.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; Set a reminder on your calendar which repeats on the 1st of every month. Everyone on the mailing list will be expected to report in with progress, revise their resolution if necessary, and recommit to the next month. The three outcomes are HIT, MISS, and (if you neglect to check in within 3 days of the beginning of the month) ABSENT. (This helps you remember to remember, which is often the main culprit for failed resolutions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Extra credit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; Start a public countdown on Twitter, Facebook, or your public venue of choice that starts at 1,000. Any time you do something that gets you a small step towards #1, state what you did along with the current number. I’ve been doing this with my aspiration to be a marathon runner and it’s been quite useful as a tool. 1,000 things is a lot, so I allow myself to include things that have a somewhat loose connection to the identity, and at the same time I am okay with missing a day here and there since getting to 0 is going to take a long time anyway. Also, because of the numbers, there will be plenty of significant milestones to celebrate along the way. (This helps you ignore small setbacks and stay focused on the long-term goal.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Are your habits tiny or huge?</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/03/13/are-your-habits-tiny-or-huge"/>
   <updated>2013-03-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/03/13/are-your-habits-tiny-or-huge</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Confession. I don’t think habits are tiny things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they’re huge things, convoluted twisting structures in our brains. Traversing all the way from triggers and automatic responses deep in the subconscious, to routines, to circumstances, to goals and values, and all the way up to our sense of selves and our identity in the neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These structures can’t just be turned with a light switch, by a new app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are structures that need to be built over time. They involve real neurons that need to change, grow, reroute, and sink in over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a new habit is like deciding to buy a new house and put it in your brain. You have to clear away some space. You have to allocate some resources. You either need a lot of money to buy the house outright, or you have to save enough money to put a down payment on a loan and then rearrange your long-term finances to figure out how you’re going to pay a mortgage for 10-30 years. You have to get lucky, the market needs to be right, you need to have a steady income, you might need to move to a new city or to a new part of the city before finding one you can afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-partner=&quot;tweetdeck&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people say it takes 14/21/30/etc days to start a new habit. They say science proves it. Research show it. Look, testimonials!LIES.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Buster (@buster) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/buster/status/311717285524017153&quot;&gt;March 13, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t buy a house in 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t buy a house with an app, or a bracelet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t decide to buy a house today, and move in tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing a behavior, or starting a new habit, requires perhaps a thousand small, intentional, actions over time. It requires committing to showing up to work for years, putting in the time. It requires getting your credit score in order (a certain level of proof that you are trustworthy when you say that you can do this). It requires that you think on the scale of 30 years rather than 3 weeks. It requires that you move somewhere that fits your current circumstances and yet still provides the lifestyle that you want. It requires that you time it in such a way that the interest rate is favorable (where you’re not having to throw money and time away needlessly). It requires that you are mentally prepared to allow this change in your life and aren’t going to self-sabotage because you don’t actually believe you deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to eat better? Want to exercise more? Want to meditate every day? Want to write every day? Want to floss more? Want to run more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t look at this want as a tiny thing. It’s not the same as buying a latte, or even a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at it as you would look at wanting to buy a house. Make lots of space for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a tiny thing, it’s a HUGE thing. You’re changing who you are, what you believe, how others will see you. You will need to call on your reputation, you’ll need to change your circumstances to best fit this new huge thing, you’ll need to ask people to trust you, to allow you to change in their eyes, and in your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing your habits or behaviors doesn’t take 21 days. It takes 1,000 intentional actions, or more. It requires creativity, resourcefulness, persistance, and vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people never have the opportunity to buy a house. Some people squander their opportunities. You are lucky. Take the opportunity seriously. Be rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or stick with couch surfing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The game of life</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/03/05/the-game-of-life"/>
   <updated>2013-03-05T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/03/05/the-game-of-life</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hoffbauer.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GameOfLife1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Game of Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while ago I tweeted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game of life. Level 1: sugar, salt, fat. Level 2: sex, drugs, rock &amp;amp; roll. Level 3: autonomy, mastery, connection.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Buster (@buster) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/buster/status/289558967322038273&quot;&gt;January 11, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It keeps re-surfacing in my brain so I thought I’d write about it some more, and release a new level while I’m at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If life were a game, the levels might be something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1:&lt;/strong&gt; sugar, fat, salt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2:&lt;/strong&gt; sex, drugs, rock &amp;amp; roll&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3:&lt;/strong&gt; autonomy, mastery, connection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 4:&lt;/strong&gt; whole-heartedness, acceptance, playfulness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Level 1’s boss is the Lizard Brain, level 2’s boss is Coolness, level 3’s boss is The Self, and level 4’s boss is Meaninglessness. If level 5 exists, I have no idea what it’s like or who the boss is. That’ll have to be added in a later release of this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point is that this is just what the game of life seems like from the level that I’m currently on, and every level has a version that reflects that level’s own constraints and biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do the levels seem like from your spot in the game?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My two brains</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/03/03/my-two-brains"/>
   <updated>2013-03-03T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/03/03/my-two-brains</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s the lizard brain, the old brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s the new brain, the neocortex, the pattern-finder that some people correlate with rationality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old brain is fast, the new brain is slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old brain is cheap, the new brain is expensive (in terms of energy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old brain is subconscious, the new brain is sometimes conscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old brain takes over in emergencies, during fight and flight, during times of high stress, during anger, passion, hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new brain takes over in times of low stress, times of calm, in the shower, on walks, during a pleasant conversation and a glass of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, it seems like there’s a bit of a seesaw, and one brain has the upper hand on the other based on the current environment and circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When heart rate and breathing speed are up, the old brain has the upper hand, and when heart rate and breathing speed are down, the new brain has the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, heart rate variability (the difference in heart rate when you are inhaling versus exhaling – see more here) is often seen as a physiological proxy that can be used to indicate your stress level, your willpower reserves, and maybe even the part of your brain that has the upper hand in the current moment. The more variability, the less stressed you currently are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that I seem to like risk and adventure, in general. My personal philosophy and decision making aesthetic has pretty much always been about going with my intuition, my gut, taking big risks for big potential reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Being too careful is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Buster Benson (@buster) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/buster/status/307895921197334528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 2, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never really gotten along with people who are cautious and who plan things too much. I like to travel without hotel arrangements ahead of time most of the time. And it doesn’t bother me when my job description is undefined to the extent that I should find meaningful things to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, the dislike of planning seems to be inconsistent with the fact that I am also very much into making goals. Changing myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized a couple days ago that it’s the connotation of the wold “plan” that triggers me. It seems futile (to my old brain, who is in charge of assigning futility to things) to plan because it implies an understanding of the future, which we don’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than try to predict a future, I subscribe to a chaotic form of forward progress: set your sites, start running in that general direction, and pick yourself up whenever you fall. That’s how I get anywhere, and it doesn’t require much planning at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But taking this back to the old and new brains, I realized that my dislike of the word “plan” has been preventing me from adopting some more subtle and beneficial planning-like strategies, and the internal monologue itself was really interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I don’t like the idea of defaulting to the old brain for all decisions. I would like to allow some decisions to route to the new brain, especially when sticking to goals over a long period of time is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning, and therefore sticking to goals, is a new brain thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my old brain has cleverly planted an emotional trigger around the word and concept of planning, so that whenever it came up I would get anxious. The anxious state is one which my old brain has more control over, and it easily vetoes further thought in the direction of planning. By the time I calm down the new brain sees how poorly that went and notices the new pattern, “Buster doesn’t like planning”. And the initial trigger is reinforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the word/concept of “meditation” has the same problem for me. I get anxious, the old brain vetoes the idea, and the new brain later determines that “Buster doesn’t like meditation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same with “going to bed early” and “morning person”. Old brain triggers immediately and says, “lame”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that many calming, planning-like concepts suffer from the same old brain overrides in our world. If an idea is easy to shoot down by the old brain, it will never be “cool” to society in general and therefore it has to be whispered in smaller friendly groups lest the speaker reveal their “new brain” tendencies in a world that spends most of its time in “old brain” thinking modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I’d like (new brain speaking) to practice using slow, calm, new brain planning even when I (old brain speaking) think it’s lame.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Our filters</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/02/23/our-filters"/>
   <updated>2013-02-23T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/02/23/our-filters</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Photo filters are quite popular these days. They’re cool because they add personality to a photo with minimal work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that OUR PERSONALITIES are also the output of a number of personal distorting filters applied to the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine an unbiased, uninterpreted, unsimplified, unprocessed, view of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then think about how you view the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many filters, distortions, and processing are there between you and the unfiltered universe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help make the point, think about COLOR.  The application of color to the universe is the result of a brain filter. One that translates a small segment of the  light spectrum into a map that relates each frequency of light to a color that represents a specific blend of those 3 colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the filters that translate shapes, textures, sounds, smells, movements, depths, etc into similarly simplified, but meaningful, objects that are easier to manipulate in our brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the filters that try to simplify things so that we can survive in a constant overload of information. We create filters designed to pull out the important information so that we can toss the rest.  This means that we are always on the look out for NEW information, SHOCKING information, and information that VALIDATES our existing theories about the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the filters that bias our brain to prefer information, ideas, things, people, etc that are close to us and useful to us. A person dying 10,000 miles from us has a completely different weight than a person dying in our arms. An idea that will make us $100 right now has a completely different weight than an idea that will make us $100 in a million years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These filters are somewhat chaotically organized as a list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases&quot;&gt;Cognitive Biases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the filters that protect us from harm. That shuttle off ideas of death, mortality, and cosmic insignificance. That comfort us by only letting information through that we feel prepared to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the filters that we think make us stand out in the world. The filters that help us preserve our personalities in such a way that we are “go getters” or “detail oriented” or “really into cats”. By preserving filters that give us personality, we are more likely to be noticed, loved, respected, and feel like we actually belong here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of all of these filters is that our personal view of the universe is much more distorted than any Instagram photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you took away all of the filters, our brains would have nothing to do and we would just sit in a firehose of information that eventually washed us away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is by filtering, distorting, simplifying, processing, and biasing the world that we have any form at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have no choice. We have to hold on to your filters. But choose them wisely, and if at all possible, remove the filter that makes us believe we have no filters on at all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The long slog</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/02/19/the-long-slog"/>
   <updated>2013-02-19T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/02/19/the-long-slog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are different modes of “work”. Here are a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Introspection. Finding yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Exploration. Finding everything else.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Goal-making. Based on values found during introspection.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Strategy-making. Hypotheses about how to achieve your goals.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Experimentation. Trying things. Playing. Iterating.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Finding fit. Person/universe fit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Slogging. Executing. Doing the work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An industry of self-help, productivity gurus, and therapists has sprouted around each of these modes of work. Much to their benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these modes require different parts of our brains. Different brainwave lengths. Different moods. Different states of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of us excel at certain modes and suck at others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each mode is strongest when the others are also at their strongest.  We must develop each of these modes in parallel. It’s all one big positive feedback loop / Catch-22 / bootstrap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do all of these in parallel: Find yourself, explore the universe, make goals, devise strategies, experiment with tactics, find a fit, slog.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Buster (@buster) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/buster/status/304057054308466689&quot;&gt;February 20, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neglecting one mode will indirectly cause other modes to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first six modes are inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last mode is the only true output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be judged in the world by our output. Therefore, some people place a lot of emphasis on the 7th mode (see pg’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html&quot;&gt;schlep&lt;/a&gt; post for a masterful articulation). It’s the fruit of your labor. But the labor itself is actually not the slog. 10,000 hours go into preparing for the slog. The slog without preparation is chasing after the wind. The slog with preparation is flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t express until you’ve explored. The best way to explore is to begin expressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long slog, the thing that feels like way too much painful effort in the beginning becomes the only reward.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>$1 for you (conclusion)</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/01/28/one-dollar-conclusion"/>
   <updated>2013-01-28T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/01/28/one-dollar-conclusion</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last September I asked people to call me out whenever I complained. The first person to call me out would get &lt;a href=&quot;http://buster.svbtle.com/1-for-you&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/a&gt;. I probably got called out at least 100 times, and appreciate all of the help from everyone who did so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pretty great as a way of crowdsourcing my own mindfulness around how much I complain (which wasn’t much, but definitely more than I had originally thought).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting side effect of the experience was that I had several good conversations about where the line is between complaining and speaking up about something that was undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely came away with the conviction that not all complaining is undesirable. Maybe 90% of complaining was the kind I should be doing less of, and then about 10% of the complaining felt “good”, especially after I became better at catching myself in the process of wanting to vocalize a complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I found that while &lt;a href=&quot;http://chirpify.com&quot;&gt;Chirpify&lt;/a&gt; is a great service for giving money to people easily over Twitter, it turned out that most people didn’t actually want the dollar (and never claimed the dollar I sent to them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be posting a new experiment soon branching out to more than just complaints, but for now, consider this experiment concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. I highly recommend others to try something like this, building off of what I learned (or not). The full benefit of the experiment is probably only really achieved by actually going through with it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Is this your best possible work?</title>

   <updated>2013-01-23T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2013/01/23/is-this-your-best-possible-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your meaningful productivity and creativity, this is the only question that really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re not doing your best possible work, ask yourself why. What’s holding you back? Is it A) you, or B) something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A)&lt;/strong&gt; If it’s you, think about your own best interest, and why it’s in your best interest to not do your best work. Most likely, it’s not in your best interest to not do your best possible work. Then, it’s a matter of shifting focus to overcoming your own resistance to your own best interest. This class of problem is about not being our own worst enemy, fighting Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B)&lt;/strong&gt; If it’s something else that’s holding you back, think about why you’re letting something else hold you back. Your best possible work has to take into consideration your environment, your constraints, and what’s possible. Get to the limit of what’s possible for you, right now. This class of problem is about not being a martyr, but rather being a scrappy cockroach that embraces the constraints and strives to be the most highly adapted creature in your current environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just set up an alarm on my phone to ask me this question every day. It’s just too costly for me to not do my best possible work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My resolution for 2013:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“At least 5 days a week, start my day proactively by doing at least one of these 6 things before looking at my phone: drink a glass of water, stretch, do pushups, do lunges, do plank, review my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haikudeck.com/p/u9qVHcR7Ts/look-look-look&quot;&gt;Look, Look, Look&lt;/a&gt; haiku deck (&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/10/05/look-look-look&quot;&gt;background on the fish thing&lt;/a&gt;).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so easy for me to fall into a mindset of reactive responses… I want to make a habit of being proactive every day. Action that starts from my own intentions rather than simply reactions to things that bounce my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To play along in my 2013 ONE resolution public accountability experiment, &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/12/28/rabbit-rabbit&quot;&gt;read about it here&lt;/a&gt; and sign up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/rabbit-rabbit&quot;&gt;join us here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Want to try something fun and different for new year’s resolutions this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-make-only-one-resolution&quot;&gt;1. Make only ONE resolution.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll forget the rest anyway. Better to do one right than to do a whole bunch wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-phrase-your-resolution-in-such-a-way-that-it-is-either-true-or-false-for-a-1-month-period&quot;&gt;2. Phrase your resolution in such a way that it is either TRUE or FALSE for a 1 month period.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, these are all properly worded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the gym at least 10 times a month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lose at least 2 lbs a month if I weigh over 175lbs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete 10 pages of my book a month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditate every week day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these are not properly worded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smile more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop procrastinating&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be a better father&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it’s really easy to create a resolution that is vague because vague is SAFE. Better than safe is clear. Step out on a ledge a little by being specific and you’ll know for certain when you’re actually on track, and it will feel good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-get-some-accountability&quot;&gt;3. Get some accountability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do this on your own if you want. Find a group of motivated friends to keep you accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of accountability is that you can’t come up with a million stupid excuses without being called out on it. I’m volunteering myself to call you out on it in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join my new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rabbit-rabbit&quot;&gt;Rabbit Rabbit Resolution Accountability Squad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’ll be a monthly check in to a large group with whether or not you did you resolution in the previous month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone that checks in, wins. Everyone that doesn’t check in will be &lt;strong&gt;called out in an email to the full group&lt;/strong&gt;.  Ooh, scary, right?  No money on the line, no embarrassing pictures mailed out, just simple accountability about whether or not you did what you said you would do to people that you’ll probably never run into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-this-interests-me&quot;&gt;Why this interests me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just my latest in a long line of experiments to see if various combinations of motivational elements and course correction strategies actually works for 1) me and 2) other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hypothesis is that monthly checkins and public accountability will lead to an interesting chemical reaction in our brains that actually helps us remember our resolutions longer than a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I just want to collect a few minds who are interested in this challenge and who don’t mind experimenting with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rabbit-rabbit&quot;&gt;Rabbit Rabbit Resolution Accountability Squad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for fun. And, if you want, help &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/buster/status/284811223827103744&quot;&gt;spread the word&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>&quot;Anything is possible.&quot;</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/12/08/anything-is-possible"/>
   <updated>2012-12-08T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/12/08/anything-is-possible</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Great straight forward explanation about &lt;a href=&quot;http://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/&quot;&gt;how habits work&lt;/a&gt; from the appendix of Charles Duhigg’s book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/&quot;&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pieces/anything-is-possible.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cue, Routine, Reward&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;THE FRAMEWORK:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Identify the routine&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Experiment with rewards&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Isolate the cue&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Have a plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, building a house is also simple, if you have the time and energy and materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my search for the holy grail answer of the question “HOW DO WE CHANGE OURSELVES”, I realize that I’ve been looking in the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking for an answer that was about the size of a menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the answer may actually be of the size of a 2-year college education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking for an answer that was about as difficult as learning how to build a lego house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the answer may actually be about as difficult as building a real house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking for an answer that cost about $100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the answer may cost about $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking for an answer that anyone could do, just like anyone can write a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the answer may only require the same amount of dedication, time, and energy as writing a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no super secret to it all (after all, Charles Duhigg lays it all out in easy to understand steps).  After all…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Anyone” can get a 2-year college degree, “anyone” can build a house, “anyone” can buy something that costs $10,000, “anyone” can write a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anything” is possible, but in the real day-to-day where we have to prioritize and budget our tasks with the actual resources available to us, the steps are sufficiently complicated, time-intensive, mentally-taxing, and physically draining that only a small subset of people will find that the &lt;em&gt;REWARD&lt;/em&gt; of changing a behavior is worth the &lt;em&gt;COST&lt;/em&gt; of changing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems pretty obvious, in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Codex Vitae</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/11/28/codex-vitae"/>
   <updated>2012-11-28T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/11/28/codex-vitae</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just finished Robin Sloan’s very fun book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008FPOIT6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B008FPOIT6&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=mockerybird&quot;&gt;Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore: A Novel&lt;/a&gt;. Here are my &lt;a href=&quot;https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights_and_notes/B008FPOIT6&quot;&gt;Kindle highlights&lt;/a&gt; on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite parts of the book was the idea of a Codex Vitae:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“And this is the other treasure. Following in the Founder’s footsteps, every member of this fellowship produces his or her own codex vitae, or book of life. It is the task of the unbound. Fedorov, for example, who you know”—he nods to me—“is one of these. When he is finished, he will have poured everything he has learned, all his knowledge, into a book like these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Codex Vitae is something that special members of this fellowship “earn” the right to create, after rising up in the ranks. When written, it’s submitted to the fellowship, approved, and encrypted. 3 copies are made of the book, 1 goes to the central library, and 2 others go to branch libraries in other parts of the world. The key to the encryption is only given to 1 person, and it remains a secret until the writer’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pour everything you’ve learned into a book, to be made public upon your death. A sort of immortality, a summary of your life’s meaning and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should all do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sort of surprised to think about this and realize that we as a culture don’t do this very consistently or well. This, as in, summarize and store our most strongly held beliefs, our most painfully wrought lessons, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reminded me a little bit of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Beliefs.md&quot;&gt;Beliefs&lt;/a&gt; file, hosted publicly on Github so I’m able to track &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/commit/c2df95a71f723e330c58c908a4f3fc2e8e911418&quot;&gt;changes over time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me8mitAhaQ1qzn9hdo1_1280.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beliefs diff&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github works really well for this because you can comment on changes, see how things change over time, fork it, branch it. There’s something magical about treating beliefs like code. It’s the code that runs our perspective of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also track other things this way. Such as my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/LifeList.md&quot;&gt;life list&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Manifesto.md&quot;&gt;manifesto/rules for living&lt;/a&gt;, and even my raw &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Genome.txt&quot;&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who else is interested in this kind of thing? Any interest in starting a group up about it? Join the discussion on &lt;a href=&quot;http://branch.com/b/what-would-you-write-in-your-codex-vitae&quot;&gt;this branch&lt;/a&gt; (I’m accepting everyone who requests to join).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off your phone when you go to bed on Friday night.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t turn it back on until you wake up on Sunday morning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During that time, also don’t use your computers to do anything that requires the Internet (I made an exception for playing Rdio).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kellianne and I tried it yesterday and we ended up having more interesting conversations and more peaceful relaxation times than we’ve had in a while. Will definitely be trying it again next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanna give it a try? &lt;a href=&quot;http://branch.com/b/disconnect-saturdays&quot;&gt;Join this branch&lt;/a&gt; to talk about it and experiment with it next Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A/B fit</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/11/18/ab-fit"/>
   <updated>2012-11-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/11/18/ab-fit</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution/problem fit:&lt;/strong&gt; A solution is a strategy that fits the needs of a specific problem. If a strategy technically works, but is too expensive, or too slow, for the specific problem, it still won’t fit and the problem will not be “solved”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startup-marketing.com/the-startup-pyramid/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pieces/ab-fit.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product/market fit:&lt;/strong&gt; a product must fit a specific market before it will take off and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idea/person fit:&lt;/strong&gt; Ideas must fit the people who are working on them. Tell 10 people an idea, and each person will know rather quickly if it fits their values, beliefs, needs, aesthetic, self-identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idea/company fit:&lt;/strong&gt; A product idea also needs to fit its company culture. I spent a couple months this year trying to help a team spread the idea of social at one company I contracted at, and it just didn’t fit. The same idea is grafted into the DNA of other companies. The quality of the idea is unimportant… what matters is that it fits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People/company fit:&lt;/strong&gt; And the people at a company must also fit its culture. Each hire changes the people/company fit of the next hire, and ultimately change the idea/company fit of ideas and products within that company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A/B Fit has been turning up everywhere for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best A (apple, app, answer) doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only the best A (apple, app, answer) that fits B (meal, situation, context).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of this are huge (at least, in my own head).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality doesn’t exist as a stand-alone attribute.  It only exists in relation to the timing, location, and needs of the present environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the quality of those environments in turn only exist in relation to the next layer of context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion of human equality has been around for a long time. However, it has taken a long time for it to fit in the culture (and still has a long way to go). The culture itself has been in a long process of fitting into the local and global needs of its people, of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural selection is a test of animal/environment fit. And as the animals adapt to the environment, the changes the environment, and changes the test for new animals in the new environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every A must take into consideration its timing, its location, its placement in the hierarchy of power and acceptance in order to know its own chance for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no perfect glove. The perfect glove fits the hand that buys it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perfect computer is the one in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perfect app is the one that you use right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perfect book is the one that speaks to your present life. The perfect word fits its sentence, paragraph, and page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those same gloves, computers, apps, and books will not be perfect if you plop them a different context, at a different time, with different circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heroes of our day fit the day perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right place, right time = right fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right place, wrong time = wrong fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right fit today may be wrong fit tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about timing. Think about placement. Think about context. Think about fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate question for our own lives: person/universe fit.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What I'm tracking now and why</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/11/04/what-im-tracking-now-and-why"/>
   <updated>2012-11-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/11/04/what-im-tracking-now-and-why</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been about 3 years since &lt;a href=&quot;/2007/02/07/history-of-my-self-tracking&quot;&gt;my last update&lt;/a&gt; on my self-tracking setup. I figured I should write about it again since I’ve recently found a system that works really well for me, and is simple enough for anyone to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-i-track-things-about-my-life&quot;&gt;Why do I track things about my life?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my long-running obsession with Quantified Self and history of tracking pretty much anything that is trackable, it has been many years now since I tracked anything simply for the pleasure of tracking it. That pleasure, for me, is gone. The only reason to track anything, now, is to learn something new and meaningful about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-am-i-tracking-right-now&quot;&gt;What am I tracking right now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found, over the years, that there are certain things in my daily routine that have more impact on my happiness, productivity, and purpose than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are small things like getting enough sleep, walking to work, eating mostly plants, doing meaningful work, running, quality time with my wife, and quality time with my son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the striking qualities of these things is that they don’t really require much gadgetry to quantify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I can use a Zeo to track sleep, and a Fitbit to track walking, and a calorie tracker to track what I’m eating, but for the purposes of finding new meaning in my life this isn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-track&quot;&gt;How do I track?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a spreadsheet saved to a Dropbox folder so I can access it from any computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fields in the spreadsheet are: date, &lt;em&gt;day of week&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;city I woke up in&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;hours of sleep&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;walked to work&lt;/strong&gt;, cups of coffee, alcoholic drinks, &lt;strong&gt;half-plants&lt;/strong&gt;, pushups, &lt;strong&gt;did meaningful work&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ran&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;quality Kellianne time&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;quality Niko time&lt;/strong&gt;, self-reported day score, algorithmic day score, and notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things I’m tracking for meaning are in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt; are things I track in order to find correlations between my meaningful metrics and possible causes, obstacles, or facilitators of meaning. For example, I want to know if I tend to get more sleep on certain days of the week, or whether or not I’m able to get more meaningful work done in Seattle or San Francisco (since I’m traveling back and forth a lot at the moment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important for me to separate the variables I track for meaning and the variables I track for impact on that meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain the last 3 fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt; is simply there so that I can remember the day in question if I ever want to re-calibrate the data for that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-reported day score&lt;/strong&gt; is a number between 1 and 3 that I use to track my subjective impression of the day. 1 is an exceptionally bad day, 3 is an exceptionally good day, and 2 is a normal day. In the past, I would track my days on a 1-10 score, or along multiple axes, but I found that to be largely futile, since I would almost always choose a number that seemed to be more precise than accurate. Days vary from hour to hour, and from role to role (family vs work, for example), and I often felt like assigning a day a 6 because it was good for family but bad for work was sort of meaningless. On the other hand, it’s very easy for me to simply ask myself if it was an exceptionally good or bad day. If neither of those is the case, it’s a 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole point of tracking the self-determined day score is so that I can validate the accuracy, over the long term, of the algorithmic day score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Algorithmic day score&lt;/strong&gt; is a number that is determined by the following function: +1 if I slept 7 or more hours, +1 if I walked to work, +1 for any meal I ate that was at least half plants, +1 if I did pushups, +1 if I did meaningful work, +1 if I ran, +1 if I had quality time with Kellianne, and +1 if I had quality time with Niko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it’s all in a spreadsheet, I can have a little control over what exactly goes into the algorithm. I can give eating half plants a bit more weight (up to a score of 3), and yet running and pushups are the same score if I do 1 pushup and run 1 minute as if I do 100 pushups and run a marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithmic day score is designed to trigger a “point” on the smallest meaningful unit that I think makes my day better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-i-like-this-approach&quot;&gt;Why do I like this approach?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this is all tracked with a very simple spreadsheet, I’m able to have control over what I think is meaningful. There’s no temptation to collect information that is precise (how many steps did I walk, how many calories did I eat) unless I also think there is a direct translation of that precision to the day’s self-reported or algorithmic scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most fields, I simply track a true or false value. Did I run? T or F. Did I have quality time with Kellianne? T or F.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggestion:&lt;/strong&gt; don’t track or collect data that isn’t immediately meaningful. Measure at the precision of meaningfulness to you. This is especially important for subjective data (how are you feeling, how stressed are you, etc) where precision is usually more misleading than not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it’s all in a spreadsheet, it’s &lt;em&gt;really forgiving of missing days&lt;/em&gt; and fields. I don’t have to fill it in every day and then look at a calendar or get feedback from a tool telling me that I suck. I can skip a week and simply add a row when I get back to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s flexible because I can add or remove a field whenever I feel like it. I’m tracking weight, for example, because I’m trying to lose a few pounds at the moment. I can track it and don’t have to feel bad about not tracking it in the past because it is only meaningful during a specific period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I can also leave out answers when I don’t have them. No need for me to weigh myself every day. For the moment, I don’t have any weight inputs in the algorithmic day score because I don’t currently think that there’s much of a correlation between my weight and the quality of the day. If that changes in the future, I can update the function in the algorithmic day score field to be retroactive (or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-visualize-this-data&quot;&gt;How do I visualize this data?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the really cool thing. There’s a new app out there called &lt;a href=&quot;http://wizard.evanmiller.org/&quot;&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; by Evan Miller that helps you create visualizations from spreadsheets! Just export it as a CSV (comma separated values) and instantly get to see if there are statistical correlations between any of your data points!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s magical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a crucial step because it is an opportunity to find connections and new meaning in the data that would’ve otherwise been nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, after a month or so of data, I am seeing that my day score is highest when I get about 7.25 hours of sleep. Under 7.25 and over 7.25 hours are both correlated to lower scores. That’s interesting! The correlation isn’t statistically significant yet, though, so I’ll keep an eye on it as I get more data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, because I’m tracking days of the week and the city I’m in, I can very quickly see how they are correlated to meaningful work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m happy with this setup because for the first time I feel like I’m tracking my life at the right level of precision. Using a spreadsheet and a simple statistical visualization tool gives me the level of control and autonomy that no other apps or services out there have been able to deliver. It’s also simple and forgiving enough that missed days, changes in life, and new ideas about what’s meaningful to track are easy to adapt to without much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My father passed away 19 years ago today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast hard yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepping back and remembering that we’re all mortal and fragile can bring us closer together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes you want to hug your family, your friends, and even random strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It adds a filter of meaning over everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moments are rare when this reality descends on us collectively, so take advantage of it. Use it to up your empathy not only for the people who are near you, but for all people who are face to face with this realization every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we could always think and act from a place of respecting the big picture, of being zoomed out and seeing the vulnerability of life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad, I miss you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every behavior change fanatic out there loves this quote. Probably has it on their bathroom mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formula is so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You = what you do every day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And therefore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;if (what you do every day == excellent)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You = excellent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also, if you’re trying to solve for excellence…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You + X = Excellence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now know that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;X = do excellent things every day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You + (do excellent things every day)  = Excellence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what you’re thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/be-excellent-to-each-other-1280x720.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Be excellent to each other&quot; caption=&quot;Be excellent to each other&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/be-excellent-to-each-other-1280x720.jpg 1x, /assets/images/pieces/be-excellent-to-each-other-1280x720.jpg 2x, /assets/images/pieces/be-excellent-to-each-other-1280x720.jpg 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more importantly, just be excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here, it becomes clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quote by Aristotle is actually not helpful at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I had a great conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/e_ramirez&quot;&gt;@e_ramirez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/cwhogg&quot;&gt;@cwhogg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/aarondcoleman&quot;&gt;@aarondcoleman&lt;/a&gt; over a few beers. It was a thoroughly enjoyable behavior-change app-building quantified-self throw down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all of us having fairly different ideas about to build RIGHT NOW, given the current state of the market, what we know about behavior change, and what works and doesn’t work, there was a moment of clarity when we all agreed on the fact that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Behavior change is belief change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t change what you do without first changing who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two parallel universes (and a rather cliched example):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You step on a scale, and don’t like what you see, and you wish you could change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You step on a scale, and don’t like what you see because that person isn’t you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first parallel universe, you are the person on the scale, and you wish you could read a book, buy a gadget, etc that would help you lose weight and be a healthier version of yourself.  &lt;strong&gt;This person will have a really difficult time changing their actions, because they first have to change the belief about who they are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second parallel universe, you look at the numbers and you look at yourself and it’s like looking at a stranger.  That person ISN’T YOU. Even though you are apparently in their body. &lt;strong&gt;This person has ALREADY changed who they are, and therefore changing actions to match that will be a lot easier.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dissonance of having a strong belief, and living in a universe where that belief seems to be false, can create a huge burst of energy that can then be channeled into changing INTO the person that you already believe that you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fc01.deviantart.net/fs22/i/2009/243/8/2/Explosion__Stock__by_EnforcedCrowd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Explosion&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the pattern that I hear over and over again with people who were able to change their behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They already believed themselves to be the person who they were changing into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, that just begs the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we change who we believe that we are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we change our core identity of ourselves? How do we change into “a runner” or “a stair-taker” or “a whole foods eater” or “a meditator” or “an optimist”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems really difficult, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone that tells you that you just need to “walk one more bus stop every morning” in order to be a healthier person has reversed the formula (putting the easy thing first) in order to sell it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be a person who walks to the bus stop every morning you have to change your core identity of yourself into a “healthier person who walks a lot”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you believe you are that person already, then you’ve already done the difficult part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accept your beliefs about who you think you are now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accept your beliefs about who you want to be.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;???&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Behavior change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Who you are vs who you want to be</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/10/06/who-you-are-vs-who-you-want-to-be"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To accept who you are seems to suggest that there’s no reason to gamble it all on who you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To gamble everything on who you want to be seems to suggest that you’re really unhappy with who you are now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has always been an unsolved paradox in my head as I generally seem, upon inspection, to be both happy where I am, and eager to gamble a lot of it on something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the shower today I decided to just let these two voices talk it out, without me getting in the way. And within about 30 seconds they had come to an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who I am now agrees to accept who I want to be, and who I want to be agrees to accept who I am now.  Neither voice will try to persuade the other on their primary belief, but rather accept that the other belief exists as strongly as their own. Seems obvious, but I can’t tell you how many years I’ve forced one or the other voice to shut up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our identities can be made out of paradoxes as long as we don’t enforce them to constantly duke it out. It’s like an auto-immune disorder of ideas, and it can all go away if we just accept that paradoxes live within us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got started on this kick of letting internal voices talk to each other without my getting in the way when I learned about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model&quot;&gt;Internal Family Systems Model&lt;/a&gt;. It’s weird but really useful sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things I love on the internet is this tap-essay manifesto slash free iPhone story app by Robin Sloan: &lt;a href=&quot;http://robinsloan.com/fish&quot;&gt;Fish&lt;/a&gt;. I return to it pretty often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise is that we have a desire to return repeatedly to the things that we love. And that, on the internet, the deluge of information overload sometimes discourages returning much to individual things. Instead, we collect containers of things, and curations of things, because they’re always new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly love the full story of Agassiz mentioned in Fish. Enough even to want to save the actual text of it here. It was written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Hubbard_Scudder&quot;&gt;Samuel H. Scudder&lt;/a&gt;. Originally published, I think, in American Poems (3rd ed.; Boston: Houghton, Osgood &amp;amp; Co., 1879).   Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-student-the-fish-and-agassiz&quot;&gt;“The Student, The Fish, and Agassiz”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was more than fifteen years ago that I entered the laboratory of Professor Agassiz, and told him I had enrolled my name in the Scientific School as a student of natural history. He asked me a few questions about my object in coming, my antecedents generally, the mode in which I afterwards proposed to use the knowledge I might acquire, and, finally, whether I wished to study any special branch. To the latter I replied that, while I wished to be well grounded in all departments of zoology, I purposed to devote myself specially to insects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“When do you wish to begin?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Now,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This seemed to please him, and with an energetic “Very well!” he reached from a shelf a huge jar of specimens in yellow alcohol. “Take this fish,” he said, “and look at it; we call it a haemulon; by and by I will ask what you have seen.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With that he left me, but in a moment returned with explicit instructions as to the care of the object entrusted to me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“No man is fit to be a naturalist,” said he, “who does not know how to take care of specimens.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I was to keep the fish before me in a tin tray, and occasionally moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar, always taking care to replace the stopper tightly. Those were not the days of ground-glass stoppers and elegantly shaped exhibition jars; all the old students will recall the huge neckless glass bottles with their leaky, wax-besmeared corks, half eaten by insects, and begrimed with cellar dust. Entomology was a cleaner science than ichthyology, but the example of the Professor, who had unhesitatingly plunged to the bottom of the jar to produce the fish, was infectious; and though this alcohol had a “very ancient and fishlike smell,” I really dared not show any aversion within these sacred precincts, and treated the alcohol as though it were pure water. Still I was conscious of a passing feeling of disappointment, for gazing at a fish did not commend itself to an ardent entomologist. My friends at home, too, were annoyed when they discovered that no amount of eau-de-Cologne would drown the perfume which haunted me like a shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Haemulon_album.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Hæmulon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor—who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was to be done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion. Half an hour passes—an hour—another hour; the fish began to look loathsome. I turned it over and around; looked it in the face—ghastly; from behind, beneath, above, sideways, at a three-quarters’ view—just as ghastly. I was in despair; at an early hour I concluded that lunch was necessary; so, with infinite relief, the fish was carefully replaced in the jar, and for an hour I was free.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On my return, I learned that Professor Agassiz had been at the Museum, but had gone, and would not return for several hours. My fellow-students were too busy to be disturbed by continued conversation. Slowly I drew forth that hideous fish, and with a feeling of desperation again looked at it. I might not use a magnifying-glass; instruments of all kinds were interdicted. My two hands, my two eyes, and the fish: it seemed a most limited field. I pushed my finger down its throat to feel how sharp the teeth were. I began to count the scales in the different rows, until I was convinced that that was nonsense. At last a happy thought struck me—I would draw the fish; and now with surprise I began to discover new features in the creature. Just then the Professor returned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“That is right,” said he; “a pencil is one of the best of eyes. I am glad to notice, too, that you keep your specimen wet, and your bottle corked.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With these encouraging words, he added, “Well, what is it like?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He listened attentively to my brief rehearsal of the structure of parts whose names were still unknowns to me: the fringed gill-arches and movable operculum; the pores of the head, fleshy lips and lidless eyes; the lateral line, the spinous fins and forked tail; the compressed and arched body. When I finished, he waited as if expecting more, and then, with an air of disappointment, “You have not looked very carefully; why,” he continued more earnestly, “you haven’t even seen one of the most conspicuous features of the animal, which is a plainly before your eyes as the fish itself; look again, look again!” and he left me to my misery.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I was piqued; I was mortified. Still more of that wretched fish! But now I set myself to my tasks with a will, and discovered on new thing after another, until I saw how just the Professor’s criticism had been. The afternoon passed quickly; and when, towards its close, the Professor inquired, “Do you see it yet?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“No,” I replied, “I am certain I do not, but I see how little I was before.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“That is next best,” said he, earnestly, “but I won’t hear you now; put away your fish and go home; perhaps you will be ready with a better answer in the morning. I will examine you before you look at the fish.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This was disconcerting. Not only must I think of my fish all night, studying, without the object before me, what this unknown but most visible feature might be; but also, without reviewing my discoveries, I must give an exact account of them the next day. I had a bad memory; so I walked home by Charles River in a distracted state, with my two perplexities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The cordial greeting from the Professor the next morning was reassuring; here was a man who seemed to be quite as anxious as I that I should see for myself what he saw.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Do you perhaps mean,” I asked, “that the fish has symmetrical sides with paired organs?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;His thoroughly pleased “Of course! of course!” repaid the wakeful hours of the previous night. After he had discoursed most happily and enthusiastically—as he always did-—upon the importance of this point, I ventured to ask what I should do next.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Oh, look at your fish!” he said, and left me again to my own devices. In a little more than an hour he returned, and heard my new catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“That is good, that is good!” he repeated; “but that is not all; go on”; and so for three long days he placed that fish before my eyes, forbidding me to look at anything else, or to use any artificial aid. “Look, look, look,” was his repeated injunction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This was the best entomological lesson I ever had—a lesson whose influence has extended to the details of every subsequent study; a legacy the Professor had left to me, as he has left it to many others, of inestimable value, which we could not buy, with which we cannot part.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A year afterward, some of us were amusing ourselves with chalking outlandish beasts on the Museum blackboard. We drew prancing starfishes; frogs in mortal combat; hydra-headed worms; stately crawfishes, standing on their tails, bearing aloft umbrellas; and grotesque fishes with gaping mouths and staring eyes. The Professor came in shortly after, and was as amused as any at our experiments. he looked at the fishes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Haemulons, every one of them,” he said; “Mr. Scudder drew them.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;True; and to this day, if I attempt a fish, I can draw nothing but haemulons.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The fourth day, a second fish of the same group was placed beside the first, and I was bidden to point out the resemblances and differences between the two; another and another followed, until the entire family lay before me, and a whole legion of jars covered the table and surrounding shelves; the odor had become a pleasant perfume; and even now, the sight of an old, six-inch, worm-eaten cork brings fragrant memories.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The whole group of haemulons was thus brought in review; and, whether engaged upon the dissection of the internal organs, the preparation and examination of the bony framework, or the description of the various parts, Agassiz’s training in the method of observing facts and their orderly arrangement was ever accompanied by the urgent exhortation not to be content with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Facts are stupid things,” he would say, “until brought into connection with some general law.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At the end of eight months, it was almost with reluctance that I left these friends and turned to insects; but what I had gained by this outside experience has been of greater value than years of later investigation in my favorite groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>$1 for you</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/09/26/one-dollar-for-you"/>
   <updated>2012-09-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/09/26/one-dollar-for-you</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to change some of my behaviors. What else is new, right? (I’ll tell you what is new!) I have a &lt;strong&gt;new strategy&lt;/strong&gt; for getting through my habit-gimmick-resistant brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between now and the end of October, I’ll give $1 to the first person who calls me out at any time if they witness me doing any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complaining about anything. Anything! Complaining is stupid.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talking ill about anyone behind their back. Gossipping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eating junk food, drinking soda.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drinking anything alcoholic except red wine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 social habits, 2 health habits: a good start for now. I might edit or add as I go along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m planning to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://chirpify.com/busterbenson&quot;&gt;Chirpify&lt;/a&gt; to pay people, since I’ve been wanting to use their service, and like how it automatically adds a public element to the self-challenge. So anyone on Twitter or the internet at large can feel free to call me out whenever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, call me out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you want me to call &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; out on anything, let me know!  It can be a thing we do. Ready?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s on!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The &quot;I don't want to&quot; habit</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/09/22/the-i-dont-want-to-habit"/>

   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/09/22/the-i-dont-want-to-habit</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If there is such a thing as “one habit that rules them all” it might be the habit of overriding the voice in my head that says, in the moment, that I don’t want to do something when, in theory, I actually &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are really interested in getting to the bottom of habits and behavior change, why not face this conflict head on and turn the act of overriding this voice, itself, into a habit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by committing to do one thing, every day, that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A) You don’t want to do, and&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;B) You don’t already do automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be something that takes under a minute (it’s really a split second of self-defiance that is the brunt of the work).  The specific action that you do can repeat from day to day, as long as you continue &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; wanting to do it every day, and it continues to be non-automatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s the anti-habit, in a way.&lt;/strong&gt;  As soon as the action becomes automatic, or enjoyable, stop (or don’t, but don’t continue for the sake of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; habit). The point of the “I don’t want to” habit is to put continuous, deliberate, willful pressure on that voice that says “I don’t want to” when, actually, you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing all kinds of other habits will then become much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tweet fearlessly</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/09/16/tweet-fearlessly"/>
   <updated>2012-09-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/09/16/tweet-fearlessly</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember when we all blogged like nobody was watching, back in 1998-2003ish. Diaryland -&amp;gt; Livejournal -&amp;gt; Movable Type -&amp;gt; Typepad -&amp;gt; Wordpress -&amp;gt; write my own -&amp;gt; back to Livejournal (yeah, I still use it).  I learned a whole lot about Kellianne by reading through 5 years of public Livejournal (she turned them all private after I told her I had read them, though). There were a few big public deals where people got fired or embarrassed by their open writing, and things slowly clamped down and people started acting safer in their writing (and less interesting, in my opinion) (I’m definitely guilty of this too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also remember when we used to tweet pretty much anything.  Lunches, crushes, opinions of your boss, deep personal thoughts. Maybe not as freely as the blogging was, but still pretty open. Back when nobody was really watching on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always tried to be the same person to everyone, simply because I’m not good at keeping my stories straight.  But I’ve noticed that rather than change who I am, I do some rigorous filtering depending on audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one thing, being older, I have more roles and each has a different filter. Writing as a husband, as a father, as an entrepreneur, as a friend, as a developer, as a bar owner, as a blah-de-blah…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I work at Twitter, it’s gotten extra weird… everything has been sprinkled with meta-consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to jot down some meta thoughts on it, as a way of trying to wrap my head around its effect on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I now get more followers per day who I have no connection to. I wonder who these people are who follow people simply because they work at Twitter. I have a strange feeling of having to live up to their expectations, even though I don’t know what they are. I’ll probably get over that soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am aware that tweets (which would include a lot about Twitter the company, since that’s where my attention is right now) now have a slightly higher bar before getting sent out… what if some tech blogger misinterprets what I’m saying?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed that people who work here are similarly hesitant to just tweet off the cuff… when it does happen, and its not just a comment or retweet of another article, it ends up on Techmeme. Over time, that seems to have scared some people away.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conversations &lt;strong&gt;inside&lt;/strong&gt; the company that are &lt;strong&gt;about&lt;/strong&gt; the company are really interesting, thoughtful, and diverse. People here are really smart and have extremely strong values and of course have thought about tweeting more than anyone else. But they don’t generally get out there. Which seems like a waste to me… of all companies, Twitter is designed to bring you closer to the people (no matter what power dynamics exist). I wish the tweeters within the company represented the high bar of transparency that can exist between employees of companies and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there are some people who are great about this. Maybe eventually there will be more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I learn more about the people here, I’m starting a list of internal employees who talk publicly and personally about Twitter, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/#!/buster/meta-twitter/&quot;&gt;Meta Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. It barely has anyone on it yet. There are still a lot of people that I probably don’t know about yet, but I’m slowly meeting more people here and want to add them as I find them. Send any suggestions to me &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/buster&quot;&gt;@buster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tweeting fearlessly don’t mean tweeting irresponsibly. It means not being afraid to be yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The half-plants diet</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/08/17/the-half-plants-diet"/>
   <updated>2012-08-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/08/17/the-half-plants-diet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Or, The Blackjack Diet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to reduce everything I know about health, and behavior change, and habits, into their simplest possible implementations.  Here’s one I’ve been kicking around that’s eating related and I’d love your feedback on it (especially if you think you’d want to try to do it with me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than counting calories, or macronutrients, or taking pictures, or logging everything, or whatever, have &lt;em&gt;only 1 line in the air that you need to think about&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-1-is-the-current-meal-more-or-less-than-half-plants&quot;&gt;Question #1: Is the current meal more or less than half plants?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What classifies as plants?  Unprocessed whole foods: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds.  That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s more than half plants (by weight, or mass, or just size, however you feel is easiest to judge) then add 1 to your tally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s less than half plants, then subtract 1 from your tally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever the tally gets to 10, or -10, or a new week starts and I feel like it, I celebrate and start over. If 10’s too low or too high, pick your own favorite number after some trial and error.  I have thought about remembering how many “sets” I win or lose, but that’s not really that necessary unless you want to.  More important is that you just keep playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;inspired-by-card-counting-in-blackjack&quot;&gt;Inspired by card counting in Blackjack&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the idea from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/466/transcript&quot;&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt; episode that talked about how to count cards while playing Blackjack. Basically, you sit at a table and whenever the dealer or a player shows a card, you subtract 1 to your tally if it’s a 10, Jack, Queen, King, or Ace, and you add 1 to your tally if it’s a 2 - 9.  When the score gets to 8 or so, the table is considered HOT, and it’s a good time to start doubling, or multiplying by 5, your bets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-do-i-think-this-is-a-good-diet&quot;&gt;Why do I think this is a good diet?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I read about nutrition, the clearer it is that things like carbs, fat, protein and all of that are not necessary to focus on.  What matters more is where those macronutrients are coming from.  If they’re coming from whole foods, then you’ll probably never have too many or not enough of them.  If they’re coming from processed or other kinds of foods, then you’ll probably get an improper balance of things.  Rather than micromanage, think less and just reach for the whole foods whenever you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are plenty of reasons why it’s not always convenient or easy to change over night.  Don’t worry about getting everything right immediately, just try to make your tally go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole point is to think less about the details, and forgive yourself for things in the short term. Focus on the long game, while making the present moment enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;some-fun-extra-variables&quot;&gt;Some fun extra variables&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8284/7805132880_3aaba2dfc5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Half Plants Tally App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep track in your head if that’s easiest.  Or, download a simple tally-keeper app (search for “tally” in the App Store of your choice).  I like the ALS Counter iPhone App (shown above).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep track of drinks too along the same lines.  Instead of half plants, go for half water in a given sitting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give yourself a cheat day (like Saturday or Sunday) where you don’t change the tally at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>A friendly safety reminder</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/08/17/a-friendly-safety-reminder"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Are your tweets safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your photos safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your MP3s safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your television shows safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your documents safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your passwords safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your computers safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your job safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your health safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your loved ones safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your money safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your neighborhood safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you safe to drive? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your investments safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the future safe? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we therefore panic? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to feel safe, things need to be permanently fixed in space and time. Isolated from the effects of time, change, evolution, adaptation, shifting environments, shifting priorities, weather, moods, economics, ecosystems, new information, and any outside influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make something safe, it needs to be plucked out of the universe and placed in a perfectly contained jar where nothing can ever touch it again.  What is that state called?  Death.  Separation from everything that it means to be alive.  We want to protect the things we love, but sometimes the desire to protect and shelter results in not allowing the things we love to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being alive is equivalent to being unsafe.  To be part of the world, to bend in the wind, to learn from mistakes, to play, to experiment, to strive to grow in the midst of risk, difficulty, and limited time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To hold your breath is to lose your breath. A society based on the quest for security is nothing but a breath-retention contest, in which everyone is as taut as a drum and as purple as a beet.” - Alan Watts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let your breath out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let yourself change. Let others change. Let companies change. Let governments change. Let philosophies change. Embrace the insecurity of not knowing if your favorite thing today will be exactly the same tomorrow.  It too needs to change, that’s the only way it has a chance to be your (or anybody’s) favorite thing tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why 'Just Do It' is bullshit</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/07/31/why-just-do-it-is-bullshit"/>
   <updated>2012-07-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/07/31/why-just-do-it-is-bullshit</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t say anything is impossible. I think that everything is possible as long as you put your mind to it and put the work and time into it.
—  Michael Phelps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beautiful lie that we all want to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take this aspirational quote apart a bit just for fun (since I’m sitting at the airport with a 2 hour delay). I think it’s important to understand why we believe these kinds of ideas and can’t help but keep spreading them around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t say anything is impossible. I think that everything is possible…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement “everything is possible” is pretty ambitious. It’s therefore pretty easy to prove false. How about swimming the 100m butterfly in 1 nanosecond? Even light can’t do that. But let’s assume that he’s actually only talking about the set of all things that are conceivably possible given the laws of physics and the human body (Olympic-brand or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;as long as you put your mind to it and put the work and time into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love how casually people throw these tasks around. If you want to be the world’s best swimmer, just decide to do it, and then practice a lot.  Oh, and:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;start swimming when you’re 7 years old&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;channel frustrations from your parents’ divorce into swimming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have an arm span that’s 3 inches longer than your height&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have large feet and double-jointed ankles so your feet can act like flippers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;produce less lactic acid than a normal person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;natural-advantages-exist&quot;&gt;Natural advantages exist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these “nothing is impossible” affirmations also downplay the fact that natural advantages exist, and that advantages can compound, especially when timing and economic conditions and luck are amongst your natural advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, we are not all doled out the same number of natural advantages as everyone else.  Obviously.  It’s not fair, but it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By accepting the role of natural advantages in the world, you can try to magnify your own natural advantages to see if they lead somewhere interesting and extraordinary.  No guarantees, but it’s a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;just-do-it&quot;&gt;Just do it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to get fit? Just decide to exercise and eat well, and then do the work and spend the time to get fit. Duh. Yes, that’s how you do it. But getting fit is difficult precisely &lt;strong&gt;because&lt;/strong&gt; the thought patterns and mind control and habit control required to put your mind to it and persevere for a long period are difficult.  That’s what &lt;strong&gt;makes&lt;/strong&gt; getting fit difficult in the first place.  So stating the problem as the solution is not helpful at all.  Give these old thought and behavior habits some credit… they are not easy to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything is possible as long as you put your mind to it and put the work and time into it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might as well also add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything is buyable as long as you have enough cash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everywhere in the universe is reachable as long as you have a good enough space ship, lots of fuel, and a lot of time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this statement rubs me the wrong way (and yeah, maybe I’m beating a dead horse at this point) is because it gives you the world and then puts the responsibility on you to pay for it.  It is spoken from a position of very high advantage without giving credit to that advantage for your success.  It’s very much the American way, I understand.  It’s not the universe’s fault if you can’t afford/lack the resources/aren’t lucky enough to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I’m trying to say is: don’t believe their bullshit. Even if it’s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Everything I (currently) know about starting and keeping habits in one long manifesto</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/07/25/everything-i-currently-know-about-habits"/>
   <updated>2012-07-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/07/25/everything-i-currently-know-about-habits</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cross-posted on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boldacademy.com/fail-proof-your-habit-decisions/&quot;&gt;Bold Academy Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity and honor of speaking at the first ever Bold Academy in Boulder, Colorado the other day. I have been trying to distill many of the ideas we’ve experimented with and learned about in Habit Labs into something that is sharable, and I used this 3-hour talk/workshop as a way to test a first draft of some of these thoughts and got some really great feedback from the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than summarize the entire talk, I thought I’d just continue to push forward some of the core ideas for ways to make your habit decisions more fail-proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-habit-decision&quot;&gt;What is a habit decision?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A habit decision is my made-up term for a sentence you write that describes a change in behavior that you intend on applying to yourself. If we were computers, this would be the script you ran on yourself to change yourself in some real way. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I am going to walk to work whenever it is not raining for 2012.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I’m going to drink 2 glasses of water before I look at my phone in the morning for the next month.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I am going to do pushups every day at 8:30am for the rest of my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important parts of a habit decision statement are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You – yes YOU – are making a conscious decision to do something different from what you usually do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s concrete (“pushups” and “run” are both better than the vague “exercise”).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s flexible (no need to specify an exact number of pushups, though “more than X” is sometimes helpful as long as X is something you think would be pretty easy to do even on a bad day).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It mentions something about frequency (every day is best, a specific time every day is better, but the key is to be specific).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is some understanding of duration. How long are you deciding to do this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-are-habit-decision-statements-important&quot;&gt;Why are habit decision statements important?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really important that you frame your decisions in words that are succinct and easy to understand. You’re attempting to introduce a new idea into your subconscious, and the less ambiguous and complex it is, the more likely it is to be accepted. Writing out your habit decision statement explicitly is a great way to give yourself a preview of how your brain is going to react to it later on. By merely saying the words out loud, you can actually hear how your subconscious reacts immediately (and that will be an important factor in how things play out with this decision). Listen to the reactions that bubble up. Do you hear positive or negative reinforcement? Does it say, “Awesome!” If so, you’re gonna have a pretty simple time with this. On the other hand, what if the voice say “no, I’m not” or “I can’t do that” or “that’ll never work”? Things are going to be a bit more difficult… and it’s important to simply accept this fact up front. Remember, despite sharing a skull with you, this voice is not you. It’s your Lizard Brain, or “the Resistance” as some call it. The key is to hear what it says, but not necessarily to allow it to control you. The rest of these tips will help even the most resistant subconscious slowly learn to accept a new habit decision statement into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-make-your-habit-decision-real&quot;&gt;1. Make your habit decision real.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing your habit decision statement up is a big step towards making it real. Saying it out loud is part of this too. But keep going until it actually feels real to you. Tell someone about it, blog about it, tweet it, buy it a domain name, throw it a party, turn it into a t-shirt, get a tattoo. Everyone has different trick for making something feel real, feel like a part of you. Find that different trick for yourself. Again, make note of how your subconscious Lizard Brain reacts to this “making it real” strategy. It’s important to get to a point where you and your Lizard Brain are both on board with this… think of yourself as the sales person and your Lizard Brain as the customer. Compromise is okay.  Make it an offer it can’t refuse. Then, it’s real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-dont-rely-on-your-brain-to-remember&quot;&gt;2. Don’t rely on your brain to remember.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People always overestimate their own excitement at the beginning of a new habit. They think that they’ll just remember to do something every day, because at the beginning it’s exciting. Excitement is a terrible long-term motivator. Go back to basics and give yourself an impossible to avoid reminder system. Here are a few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Set an alarm on your phone.&lt;/em&gt; This is my favorite one. I’ve had an alarm on my phone for over 4 years at the same time every day (8:36pm, when I take a picture and tweet it). I also have one at 8:30am to do pushups. In both cases, I hit snooze until I do it. It works better than almost anything else I’ve tried… but everyone is different.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Set a reminder on your calendar app of choice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Put a post-it note somewhere that you are sure to see it every day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add a reminder to your phone’s lock screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a commitment to do something right before something else that you do every day already. I drink 2 glasses of water before I let myself look at my phone in the morning. You better believe that I drink those 2 glasses of water right away every day!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-train-yourself-to-respond-to-your-own-triggers&quot;&gt;3. Train yourself to respond to your own triggers.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Chuck Close&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a really important one, and a meta-habit that everyone should practice. Remembering to do something is useless unless you also actually do it when you remember. It means NOT listening to that part of your brain that says “I want to do this” or “I don’t want to do this”. It means making the behavior small enough that you can brute-force-just-fucking-do-it even when you don’t want to do it. It means removing the requirement for creativity and inspiration from the first steps of your behavior (don’t think about writing something awesome, just think about typing gibberish words; don’t think about running your fastest or farthest, just think about putting your shoes on and getting out the door). Design the first step to be so emotion-free that a Roomba could do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just consider for a moment how utterly ridiculous it is that we often wait to find Inspiration (with a capital I) before acting on something that we already know we want to do. If your habit is to do some pushups, just do them without talking yourself into it. Skip that step. You are the doer of pushups, goddammit! You don’t need approval from your Lizard Brain. You don’t need a tiny pellet of dopamine in order to get off your ass. Break that addiction to dopamine as the approval you need in order to act. Eventually, it will get easier. But in the beginning your Lizard Brain will talk all kinds of shit about you for disobeying it. You are not your Lizard Brain. The Lizard Brain works for you, not the other way around. This is easier said than done, but it must be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a day when you were able to set a trigger for your future-self (say, a blue dot on your bathroom mirror) and you didn’t have to fish around for a reason to floss whenever you saw it. Save that dopamine for something that actually needs creativity and inspiration, which is best used when you’re already well into the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-plan-for-sick-days-low-energy-days-bad-mood-days-busy-days-and-days-where-youre-not-in-your-usual-environment&quot;&gt;4. Plan for sick days, low energy days, bad mood days, busy days, and days where you’re not in your usual environment.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to get sick, but imagine if our bodies were never prepared for when we actually did come down with something. We’d be dead in a matter of days after being born, right? Which is the same fate that your habits will have unless you have a plan for down days. Come up with cheat days, or something that you think you can do even when you have no time or energy to do it. Give yourself permission to do less, or nothing at all, ahead of time so that your Lizard Brain doesn’t have the opportunity to say “you are changing the rules and you suck” when it does happen. It will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-focus-on-the-enjoyable-aspects-of-the-habit-as-you-do-them&quot;&gt;5. Focus on the enjoyable aspects of the habit as you do them.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re doing your habit, focus your attention on the pleasurable aspects of what you’re doing as you do them. Feel the spike of energy and bigness of your lungs after doing pushups. Enjoy the slowness of time when you meditate. Notice the texture of words as you write. Feel the emotional, physical, mental, social, and spiritual resistance building up simply as a side effect of practicing a habit consciously. Don’t exaggerate it too much, or else you might start trying to get into a competition for the most enjoyable this or that. Just put an tiny smiley face on the moment in time and watch it fade away with each second. Wave goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-practice-tracking&quot;&gt;6. Practice tracking.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our tech-loving society has pulled a fast one on us and made us believe that tracking is an aid to any habit. For most people, it’s more of a barrier than an aid. Tracking is a habit in itself, and should be treated separately from whatever habit decision you’re currently working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not someone who naturally tracks everything you do in life, think about breaking off a separate habit decision statement for the habit of tracking. Practice tracking something other than a behavior that’s important to you. Experiment with tracking in a journal, and on a calendar in your kitchen, and with an app on your phone, and see which ones feel natural and enjoyable to you. I personally do my tracking via an SMS journal I built called Peabrain, which is private but allows tracking of anything via #hashtags. Don’t blame yourself if a tool doesn’t work for you… just keep looking until one resonates with you. And remember that tracking is NOT essential to changing your behavior. Treat each habit and behavior separately, and until you have momentum, don’t stack them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-practice-talking-to-yourself-nicely&quot;&gt;7. Practice talking to yourself nicely.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another habit that can be played by anyone but which takes a lifetime to master. Pay very close attention to how you talk to yourself when things don’t go according to your expectations. What names and labels do you put on yourself? What words does the voice use? When did you first hear them? Who first said them to you? Do the words, when spoken out loud, still ring true? Since you’re saying them to yourself, give yourself permission to take back the meanest things, and instead offer yourself more patient, understanding, and constructive feedback. Sometimes it helps to write out dialogue between two sides of yourself and to act as a moderator that wants to keep things civil and constructive. These are some of my most productive sessions on 750words.com. Since these conversations can be private and entirely in your head, there’s no need to feel embarrassed about it. Have fun with it instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;8-celebrate-occasionally&quot;&gt;8. Celebrate occasionally.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of #6 (the practice of tracking) is that it helps present numbers to you, and round numbers are great reasons to celebrate. Your 10th day doing pushups! Celebrate! 3 days in a row! Celebrate! You’ve done 1000 pushups total! Celebrate! There are so many ways to track things, and so many ways to come up with round numbers, that you can almost celebrate every day. And why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;9-schedule-regular-monthly-reviews-with-yourself&quot;&gt;9. Schedule regular monthly reviews with yourself.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do this right now. Schedule a 30-minute meeting with yourself to occur in 1 month, and to recur every month after that. Make the meeting non-negotiable, and if for some reason it has to be rescheduled, reschedule it but don’t cancel it. Your agenda for the meeting is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thank yourself for another month of effort.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forgive yourself for any lapses along the way. You have a lot going on!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Celebrate any progress made, even if it’s simply that you made time for this meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review your habit decision statement and change any wording that you think will make it more you-friendly for the next month.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restart the habit decision if it needs restarting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;10-restart-without-fuss&quot;&gt;10. Restart without fuss.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restarting doesn’t need to be a big deal. In fact, many habits become more likely to succeed after each lapse. Count your lapses, and celebrate them. Each lapse gets you a better long-term success story. Imagine being the person who can say, “I tried to quit smoking 150 times, and lapsed 149 times.” Make lapses fun and track them with hash marks on an imaginary jail cell somewhere. Imagine PacMan dying, and then re-appearing again full of zest for life as if nothing had happened. That can be you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t really fail, because you get to create the rules. If you’re particularly hard on yourself, try not even using the word “failure”. Think of it all more like a boss. You hire habit decisions, and are the manager in charge of trying to make sure they thrive in the workplace of your brain and life. Sometimes, even the best intended habit decisions turn out to be a bad fit. It’s not the habit’s fault, or the brain’s fault.  It’s a matter of cultural and self-identity fit. As manager, you can demote ill-fitting habit decisions. You can even fire them. You are not failing the habit decision that doesn’t work out, the habit decision is getting fired. Doesn’t that feel better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-embrace-flux&quot;&gt;11. Embrace flux.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last myth of habits is that they are forever. We live in a universe that has only one constant: that everything changes. Any attempts to fix something permanently to your brain, or your life, or the world will ultimately lead to frustration. Instead of trying to make something permanent, just try to integrate it into the moving flow of your life. Let it weave back and forth in prominence and bob up and down as is fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new behavior or habit isn’t successful when you stop thinking about it. It’s successful when it fits perfectly into your sense of self. It becomes a part of you and becomes indistinguishable from the person that you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, this is not about simply changing your behaviors, or controlling your life, or becoming automatic. None of that is even possible, much less desirable. It’s really about lifting your whole identity into a more functional whole, one that fights against itself less, one that moves, thinks, and expresses in tune with your true self. And it takes practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start any time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A duck bears no grudges</title>

   <updated>2012-07-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/07/11/a-duck-bears-no-grudges</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Habit Labs is ending soon, the third company I’ve started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one, The Robot Co-op, still lives on in some form or another, with 43things.com (and myriad other offshoots).  Its question: what do you want to do with your life?  Currently owned by Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one, a bar / art gallery / private membership club called McLeod Residence. Its promise: an home for extraordinary living through art, technology, and collaboration. And alcohol. We closed up after 2 years because of a lost battle with city permits, and also because we had no idea really what we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;750 Words led to Locavore and Locavore led to Health Month and Health Month led to Habit Labs and Habit Labs led to Budge and Budge led to a dead end (maybe more like a small cul-de-sac). The last couple years have taught me that my life’s creative purpose comes in the form of a question: “How do we change ourselves?” All of my guesses so far have been mostly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sold Health Month to someone who I believe will be able to make something of it.  Not sure what is going to happen to Budge yet.  Habit Labs as a company is pretty much over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies, at least the kinds that I’m interested in building, are voyages into the unknown. They become tales of inspiration, and people are rallied, and they hop in a boat and sail off… but not very many of them find a shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fear of disappointing people has set off its alarm many times over the last 6 months. Investors, employees, people who use the sites, family, friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m contracting at Amazon for the moment, having taken a life boat back to shore, welcomed by many of the same people that I bid farewell to almost 10 years ago.  They’ve made a life, and I’m starting over. But I feel strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that startups are extremely risky. And everyone secretly believes that they know how to cheat risk. Buoyed not a little bit by the fact that our culture is saturated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias&quot;&gt;survivorship bias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to wait until I have a success story to start telling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not giving up. Quite the opposite. As ugly and awkward as it is to take three strikes and refuse to walk away from the batters’ box, I plan to keep throwing myself against the wall of technology and behavior change and making life better until something gives. Either my head’s gonna crack open or the brick’s gonna start chipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, we all die in the end anyway. Nobody’s going to be using this skull after I’m done with it so might as well give it a good pounding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to be here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big things are yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s possible to remain positive and confident in the face of repeated failure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Failure doesn’t hurt that much as long as you haven’t betrayed yourself or those who’ve agreed to come on the ship with you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As long as you don’t betray others, and you strive to be your best self even in your weakest hour, they will not be disappointed in you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A duck bears no grudges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A duck pulls no punches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the way of the duck.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>36: Talk it out</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/05/28/talk-it-out"/>
   <updated>2012-05-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2012/05/28/talk-it-out</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I had to say about &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2011/05-28-love-the-struggle&quot;&gt;turning 35&lt;/a&gt; last year.  The motto for the year was more presciently chosen than I could’ve known at the time.  &lt;strong&gt;Love the Struggle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year I chose a theme for the year.  Here are a few of the previous:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/05-28-cultivate-the-core&quot;&gt;34: Cultivating the core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/05-28-frugal-to-the-max&quot;&gt;33: Frugal to the max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008/05-27-no-problem&quot;&gt;32: No problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/05-29-double-down&quot;&gt;31: Double down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006/05-31-higher-highs-lower-lows&quot;&gt;30: Higher highs and lower lows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the struggle this year had to do with running a business on a tight budget, with a difficult problem, and a tiny team. I have some regrets for the year, mostly about not making decisions quickly and confidently enough. Maybe I was too tolerant of the struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, I do love the struggle. I love being close to the core, close to the most meaningful work. It was painful to stay focused on the meaningful parts of the life (trying to add value to the world, being connected to family, helping others) even while less important but more urgent items nipped at my heels. The strange thing about life is that nobody else can really know how difficult the decisions were to make, and they probably wouldn’t care if you told them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my 36th year, I would like my motto to be to &lt;strong&gt;Talk it out&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve been keeping a lot of my struggle to myself (and some close friends/family). It’s part of the default mindset one has when running a business and being afraid to show weakness to investors, press, the public, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when things really did get difficult, and I had no choice but to tell the story with others, and ask for help, things got a lot less strugglesome and became more of a shared challenge. My fear of disappointing others was mostly unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been going to counseling too for similarly themed topics in my relationship with Kellianne.  Talking it out takes two steps.  It forces me to first think about what it is I am trying to say.  And second of all, to say it in a way that the person/people I’m talking to are best able to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of communication is about creating or breaking connections.  Even contentless small talk is about finding a point of relation between two people.  As I’ve started paying attention to this, I’ve noticed just how many times the content of a conversation appears to be one thing (connect) while the tone or context of the conversation says exactly the opposite (disconnect).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ve learned to be public on the internet, I think many of us (myself included) have created strategies for appearing sincere without actually being sincere.  By trying to talk it out this year, I’m gonna try to think out loud a bit more, mixing up my personal and professional lives, sharing the difficulties as well as the successes and the boring parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of allowing myself to be boring, my birthday also marks the anniversary of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=8%3A36pm&amp;amp;w=35034346886%40N01&amp;amp;s=rec&amp;amp;z=t&quot;&gt;8:36pm project&lt;/a&gt;, which has now been going for 4 years.  I wrote a longer post about that that should go out sometime soon so I won’t say much more about that yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year since 2007 I spend a moment on my birthday reviewing and editing my list of “rules to live by”.  Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must not dilly-dally, so that your fears don’t trick you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be your word, so that you speak confidently.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must have good intentions, so that you don’t betray yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must admit to being the maker of meaning, so that you know what you’re getting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must not feel sorry for yourself, so that you do not become a martyr.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must have a vision that you are striving for, so that you don’t get lost in incremental improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must tie creativity and experimentation with survival, so that you don’t take your work lightly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be the change you want to see, so that you don’t blame others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must rally others with your vision, so that your ideas are tested.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must stake your reputation on your better self, so that you become your better self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be comfortable with the consequences of being who you are, both positive and negative.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must share, so that your motivations remain clear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must make your own advice and take it, so that you trust yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must manage your stress, health, and clarity, so that you stay in balance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must study your mistakes, so that you dont’ take them too seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must retry things you don’t like every once in a while, so that your tastes grow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must make time to enjoy things, so that you have time to enjoy things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part one of talking it out is that I’ve started using a public Github repository to share my rules for living, my beliefs, and my life list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/&quot;&gt;Read it or fork it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in Seattle, come to Saint Johns tomorrow (Tuesday May 29th) around 8 o’clock to have a drink with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Memorial Day!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What I’ve learned taking photos every day at 8:36 p.m.</title>

   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2011/06/11/what-ive-learned-taking-photos-every-day-836pm</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On January 4th, 2006, a Wednesday, I wrote this in my LiveJournal (long live LiveJournal!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This weekend I was walking to a bar or something with a friend and we walked along this big guy (sort of a down-and-out kind of guy, but probably not homeless) who had a giant boom box on his shoulder and it was playing The Impossible Dream loudly and he was singing along and walking so slowly, swaying. We started singing too, and it was a moment. It was the most beautiful, sad, awesome, terrible, beautiful, terrible, horrible, awesome, sad, and beautiful thing… I spontaneously burst out in tears and started laughing. I have been listening to the song over and over since… something about the whole scene just tears me apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s a bit dramatic, but the moment has stuck with me for the last 6 years partially because of it.  We’re so accustomed to being practical these days. Living within the realm of the doable and the possible.  Constraining ourselves to that which is so lean, so agile, so hedged, so data-driven and user-tested and over-funded that it cannot fail. So… safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, it sent me off on a slight obsession with impossible dreams, and their fragmented, imperfect, usually ill-appreciated manifestations in real life.  Especially artful things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avantgame.com/cookierolling.htm&quot;&gt;Jane McGonigal’s Cookie Rolling project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/15131&quot;&gt;Jamie Livingston’s polaroid project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus&quot;&gt;Camus’s Myth of Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a bit of a celebration of the imperfect in the impossible dream. Of wabi-sabi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 22nd, 2008, a few days before my 32nd birthday, I stumbled upon my own version of an impossible dream, inspired heavily by Jamie Livingston’s polaroid project and a tweet from a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;8:36pm: Deciding to accurately tweet exactly what I&amp;#39;m doing at 8:36pm for one week.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Chadwick Dahlquist (@bugeats) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bugeats/status/810771610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 14, 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal: Take a photo every day at 8:36 p.m. and share it with a caption of what I’m doing.  The twist, however, is that I started it with the goal of never stopping.  To do it every day for the rest of my life.  The complete opposite strategy recommended by anyone who knows anything about how to form habits (which is my line of work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, against all odds, it seems to be sticking (crossing fingers).  That was approximately 1,464 days ago.  4.01 years. Happy birthday, us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started, I’ve posted photos and tweets at or around 8:36pm 1,448 times.  I’ve missed only 16 days, or 1.09 percent of the days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that time, my relationship with Kellianne and arrival of my son has made it into some of the more memorable photos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/2912869033/&quot;&gt;October 4th, 2008, the day I Kellianne and I got married.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/3821616907/&quot;&gt;August 14th, 2009, the night Kellianne probably got pregnant.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/4610207325/&quot;&gt;May 15th, 2010, the day our son was born.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of other things going on as well: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/5200109781/&quot;&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/5152568981/&quot;&gt;east coast friends&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/2967679722/&quot;&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/5140956035/&quot;&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/4839264989/&quot;&gt;sunsets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/5070413377/&quot;&gt;weddings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/6184195404/&quot;&gt;more weddings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/5996857628/&quot;&gt;more weddings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/6259761948/&quot;&gt;birthdays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/4015296311/&quot;&gt;more birthdays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/3661936122/&quot;&gt;camping&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/6567395123/&quot;&gt;holidays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/6333164971/&quot;&gt;live shows&lt;/a&gt;, and many more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake about it.  99 percent of the photos posted at 8:36 p.m. are BORING.  You can look and verify this for yourself &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=8%3A36pm&amp;amp;w=35034346886%40N01&amp;amp;s=rec&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/6827875185/&quot;&gt;often&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/6860648671/&quot;&gt;working&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/6837637372/&quot;&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/6815243613/&quot;&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; from work.  A lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/6057628023/&quot;&gt;dinner&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/3184159218/&quot;&gt;eating&lt;/a&gt; happens for me around then.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/2782502387/&quot;&gt;And&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/4444115281/&quot;&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the last couple years, a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/4933390977/&quot;&gt;bath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/7147104277/&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/7019800893/&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/6945566953/&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; is happening. Lots of photos where it’s too dark to see anything, or where I look for something in my living room that I haven’t taken a photo of yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boring factor, however, is absolutely central to the vision of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is mostly boring, with spikes of excitement and drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-ive-learned-after-doing-this-for-401-years&quot;&gt;What I’ve learned after doing this for 4.01 years&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that there is beauty in the impossible, in the unfinishable, in the imperfect.  I’ve learned that it’s okay to be boring, and to let other people know you’re boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that having something that I consciously commit to doing every day for the rest of my life is rewarding and fulfilling to a part of my subconscious brain that doesn’t often get rewarded. It was hungry for this, and is thankful that I’ve given it something to chew on.  I’ve learned that every day, the accumulation of mostly meaningless, uncurated life feels a tiny bit more beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the beginning of year 5 of the project, I’m interested in helping other people recognize and enjoy this a bit more in their own lives.  A bunch of friends and strangers have already joined in on the 8:36 p.m. project, which has no central repository or community, and which is definitely open to any one else to join.  But you may want to do something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make every day of your life your own.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>35: Love the struggle</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2011/05/28/love-the-struggle"/>
   <updated>2011-05-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2011/05/28/love-the-struggle</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m 35! Luckily, the roller-coasters of entrepreneurship and parenthood don’t really let things drift accidentally out of perspective, only to be thrust upon one at yearly anniversaries. The sense of mortality, obscurity, youth vs age, and passing opportunity never get taken much for granted these days… I have the luxury of insomnia and feeling like a grain of sand in a big universe on a pretty much daily basis. And I feel exactly 35 right now. Honestly, it feels great. Bring it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My tradition since turning 30 has been to come up with a motto for the year. Previous years include: &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006/05-31-higher-highs-lower-lows&quot;&gt;Higher Highs and Lower Lows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/05-29-double-down&quot;&gt;Double Down&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008/05-27-no-problem&quot;&gt;No Problem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/05-28-frugal-to-the-max&quot;&gt;Frugal to the Max&lt;/a&gt;, and last year was &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/05-28-cultivate-the-core&quot;&gt;Cultivate the Core&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve all had personal meaning to me, and more than anything capture my frame of mind at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I have decided on the motto: &lt;strong&gt;Love the Struggle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a new parent is a struggle. Starting a new business is a struggle. Staying with your values and staying healthy and keeping a good perspective and a calm mind is a struggle. Struggling is good. It is one of the only things that exercise the deep well of will and vitality within us. That help us dig into ourselves deeper, that push us to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love the struggle, as much as it sometimes feels like a pain in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read this in a parenting book today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Kids repeadedly set their sights on something they can’t yet do. Many fuss, cry, and make loud noises while they struggle. Some work for a while, take a break, and come back to the task at hand–until they either succeed or give up. Most persist until they eventually figure out how to accomplish their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Parents play an important role in children’s struggles. We can provide the vision and the optimism that struggle does lead to success and offer support while children are trying to learn something on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yet parents who are uncomfortable with struggle may find themselves wanting to avert their children’s frustration. Your ten-month-old daughter is struggling to fit that wide blue plastic letter into the slot of her mailbox, and you feel tempted to help her just a little–to guide her hand, to help her do it faster. For many of us, “successful” parenting includes protecting our child from having a hard time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yet ironically, interfering too much can actually make things harder for children in the long run. When we repeatedly intervene, we can take the struggle–and the victory–away from our kids.“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-From Becoming The Parent You Want To Be, pg 19&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember my father bringing up in a regular family dinner one night that he feared that our lives (my sister’s and mine) were too easy. That we hadn’t had to fight for anything. That great people were never made out of easy lives. And it was true that ours were easy lives. We had privileged environments, good education, loving parents, confidence in our abilities, and opportunities to use them. But we hadn’t been tested. We hadn’t had to really work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than a year later my father passed away from cancer. Fires rolled across the hills less than a mile from my bedroom window. And I was off to my first year of college. The 17 years after my father’s death have definitely been more strugglesome than the 17 years before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficult is not bad though. Difficult is good. Difficulty and struggle have helped me more than hurt me. It’s the paradox of life, and business, and parenting. If asked at the time if I could reverse any of these struggles, I would most likely have opted into reversing them. And yet they have become the cornerstones of my life, the points that I was given a chance to step up and overcome and prove something to myself, and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is just a little reminder to myself as I try to do about twice as much every day as I have time to do, and have no plan on moving towards strugglelessness anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I focus on loving the struggle, I can stop resisting it and instead focus on thriving within it. Kicking struggle’s ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today also marks the 3-year anniversary of taking a picture at 8:36pm every day. I actually started on May 22nd, 2008, but consider it a birthday-inspired project. I’ve now taken over a thousand photos at 8:36pm (1,096 to be exact, missing 5 days in the last 3 years). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=8%3A36pm&amp;amp;w=35034346886%40N01&amp;amp;s=int&amp;amp;z=t&quot;&gt;Here are some of the most interesting ones&lt;/a&gt; according to Flickr. Hover over the images for descriptions. I plan on doing this for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s my yearly review of my “rules to live by”, which I’ve been editing since &lt;a href=&quot;https://buster.livejournal.com/104233.html&quot;&gt;January of 2007&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must not dilly-dally, so that your fears don’t trick you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be your word, so that you speak confidently.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must have good intentions, so that you don’t betray yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must admit to being the maker of meaning, so that you know what you’re getting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must not feel sorry for yourself, so that you do not become a martyr.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must have a vision that you are striving for, so that you don’t get lost in incremental improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must tie creativity and experimentation with survival, so that you don’t take your work lightly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be the change you want to see, so that you don’t blame others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must rally others with your vision, so that your ideas are tested.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must stake your reputation on your better self, so that you become your better self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be comfortable with the consequences of being who you are, both positive and negative.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must share, so that your motivations remain clear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must make your own advice and take it, so that you trust yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must manage your stress, health, and clarity, so that you stay in balance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must study your mistakes, so that you dont’ take them too seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must retry things you don’t like every once in a while, so that your tastes grow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must make time to enjoy things, so that you have time to enjoy things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my present this year, I’d like you to donate something to Kiva, Donors Choose, Vittana, or 826 Seattle. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>34: Cultivate the core</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2010/05/28/cultivate-the-core"/>
   <updated>2010-05-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2010/05/28/cultivate-the-core</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one was on a blog that got deleted. Found a copy of the text and archiving it here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I turned 30, my birthday motto was &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006/05-31-higher-highs-lower-lows&quot;&gt;Higher highs and lower lows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I turned 31, my birthday motto was &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/05-29-double-down&quot;&gt;Double down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I turned 32, my birthday motto was &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008/05-27-no-problem&quot;&gt;No problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, my 33rd birthday coincided with my last day at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotcoop.com/&quot;&gt;Robot Co-op&lt;/a&gt; and the beginning of &lt;a href=&quot;http://enjoymentland.com/&quot;&gt;Enjoymentland&lt;/a&gt;. My motto for the year was &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/05-28-frugal-to-the-max&quot;&gt;33: Frugal to the max&lt;/a&gt;. I just did a little calculation and it looks like our spending over the last 12 months compared to the 12 months prior was 34% lower. So, at least on the money front, I think we did pretty well on the frugality goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I spent the whole year working on my own projects, and managed to stay somewhat afloat finance-wise. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/collections/72157623971182557/&quot;&gt;we had a baby&lt;/a&gt;. I guess that’s not very frugal on the DNA front. But we did have the baby in fairly frugal way: without selling the house (not our choice), without buying a car, without doing all of the screening tests, and hospital visits, and without even requiring a hospital’s intervention. I’m pretty proud about that, and think Kellianne’s more amazing than ever for having gone through the process with such grace, strength, and confidence. And we were also very lucky, as there were a couple near misses on needing a hospital transfer, and I know that it’s entirely possible for someone who does everything right, and has the best intentions, to still have a high-risk pregnancy. Â We are lucky that we never had to draw that straw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brain on this morning of my 34th birthday is highly rearranged from previous years (I think I say that every year though). I’m not quite sure what this new arrangement is all about yet. I’m definitely still thinking a lot about building things. Over the last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/locavore/id306140158?mt=8&quot;&gt;Locavore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://750words.com&quot;&gt;750 Words&lt;/a&gt; have been successful and highly enjoyable to work on, and I will continue to work on them, but I’m still looking for something. There is another less public project that I’ve been working on for a good part of the year, and I hope to be able to talk more about it soon. Its future is still in flux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I guess during this month that I’m taking off from working on anything, I am still thinking very much about what I’m going to want to work on, what I am working on, and what’s going to sustain us over then next 5 to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I’m rather obsessed with my 13 day-old son, Niko, Mr. Crane, and plan on putting a big chunk of my mental and physical energy into guiding his person and personality. I feel like my work and home interests dovetail into a common goal of enjoying and appreciating the short confusing surprising life we’ve found ourselves in, and if everything can find inspiration in that tangle, everything should tie together pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/busterbenson/status/14888451749&quot;&gt;Retweeted&lt;/a&gt; last night, and still appropriate this morning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Human nature has a tendency to Admire Complexity and Reward Simplicity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another somehow related quote from page 37 of Hemingway’s &lt;em&gt;Garden of Eden&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Be careful, he said to himself, it is all very well for you to write simply and the simpler the better. But do not start to think so damned simply. Know how complicated it is and then state it simply.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, only a few years ago I had such a different view of parenthood and baby-making. I thought of it as a Plan B, something to do when you had struck out with your own personal ambitions. A way to pass the buck to the next generation. I interpret things differently now, of course, and think that building a family is a great foundation and source of strength to work with, for, and from. We all need a core, and that core needs to grow. A solid core will help make the right decisions and recover from mistakes and bad luck without sinking the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to find the core, but it’s equally important to cultivate it. Rotate the crops, bring in new soil, let it rest and recover. It’s a living thing, and our deepest values and strongest convictions are going to ebb and flow and shift in the wind just like any other living thing. The core is going to have moods, and get sick once in a while, and the only way to keep it going for the long haul is to feed it, challenge it, allow it to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a core set of goals to live by for 3 years now, and it has been shifting every year or so, adapting to my life. I post it on the front page of my homepage, &lt;a href=&quot;http://busterbenson.com/&quot;&gt;busterbenson.com&lt;/a&gt;, as a reminder more to myself than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here they are, one more time, with a bit more temporarily added to each sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must not dilly-dally, so that the Resistance doesn’t trick you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be your word, so that you trust yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must have good intentions, so that you do not betray yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must admit to being the maker of meaning, so that you know what you’re getting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must not feel sorry for yourself, so that you do not become a martyr.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must have a vision that you are striving for, so that your work moves in a direction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must tie creativity and experimentation with survival, so that you don’t take your work lightly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be the change you want to see, so that you don’t blame others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must rally others with your vision, so that your vision gains momentum.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must stake your reputation on your better self, so that you become your better self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be comfortable with the consequences of being who you are, so that you grow in responsibility.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must share, so that your motivations remain clear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must make your own advice and take it, so that you trust your own instincts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must manage your stress, health, and clarity, so that your core stays in balance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must study your mistakes, so that you don’t make incorrect generalizations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must retry things you don’t like every once in a while, so that your tastes grow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must make time to enjoy things, so that you have time to enjoy things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want this year to be the year of cultivating the core.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>33: Frugal to the max</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2009/05/28/frugal-to-the-max"/>
   <updated>2009-05-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2009/05/28/frugal-to-the-max</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one was on a blog that got deleted. Found a copy of the text and archiving it here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I turned 30, my birthday motto was &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006/05-31-higher-highs-lower-lows&quot;&gt;Higher highs and lower lows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I turned 31, my birthday motto was &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/05-29-double-down&quot;&gt;Double down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I turned 32, my birthday motto was &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008/05-27-no-problem&quot;&gt;No problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, the motto has helped me frame the upcoming year and give it some kind of direction. Those three mottos are pretty much a table of contents of my 30s so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I turn 33, and I the motto for this year is going to be “Frugal to the max”. I’m starting a new company, we’re planning to start a new family, and I think it’s time for the essentials of life to come into sharp focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I woke up around 5am and did my usual iPhone surfing from bed, but nothing was happening (other than Dita Von Teese returning from Paris). So I sat there and had this strange realization of the shortness of life. To be able to sit in bed, with an exciting day ahead, with the love of my life right next to me, while we are young, full of energy and ideas, hopeful, excited, and the world seems to be in sync with our goals and hopes – it’s a snapshot of time that I truly appreciate. I laid awake and savored everything that I have right now, and promised not to let it slip by without being fully appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning frugal is how I’m going to appreciate. And from what I can tell from people who I’ve talked with this about, it seems like we’re all interested in getting back to basics and truly savoring the essentials of life: love, friendship, health, quality time, creativity, sustainability, balance, and sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I celebrate with friends, tomorrow I start something new.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>32: No problem</title>
   <link href="https://notes.busterbenson.com/2008/05/27/no-problem"/>
   <updated>2008-05-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://notes.busterbenson.com/2008/05/27/no-problem</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The theme of my 30th birthday, and the following year, was &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006/05-31-higher-highs-lower-lows&quot;&gt;Higher highs and lower lows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme of my 31st birthday, and the following year, was &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/05-29-double-down&quot;&gt;Double down&lt;/a&gt;. Double down on love, on friends, and on my projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I feel like I should shift the focus a bit. Not so much about building building building, and more about enjoying what has been built and what happens to exist. This is a big deal for me cause I almost always feel like I’m not doing enough. That I have to keep being more ambitious, thinking bigger, not getting too lax lest I fall into a rut, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as a reminder to myself, I’m gonna re-post my “unified theory of enjoyable living” which I started putting together in January of 2007 and have been adding to and editing since then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I. IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not what you do, but how you do it&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not what happens to you, but which qualities it brings out in you&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do unto yourself and others always with your best judgment&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pursue shared enjoyment&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;II. PREPARATION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t dilly dally&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t feel sorry for yourself&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exercise, eat healthy, and manage stress&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dress and appear as your best self&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strive to know yourself&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tell people about yourself&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Appreciate your different energy levels and moods&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice body language&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep your word&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be the change you want to see in the world&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harness the ability to focus your attention&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be a beacon of strength&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;III. EXECUTION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try to have good intentions&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be the maker of your own meaning&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participate in extraordinary problems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explore all options and hedge bets while exploring&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be confidently all-in once a decision has been made&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strive for a lifestyle vision&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stake your reputation on your vision&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invite others to help you&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take responsibility and credit for your own failure and success&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be comfortable with big failure and big success&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IV. CALIBRATION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Retry things you don’t like or agree with every once in a while&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider criticism from people who know you&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Listen closely for things you can’t easily hear&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relax and always give yourself and others a break&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had the best birthday weekend ever.&lt;/strong&gt;  All of you are amazing.  I love you.  Best friends ever, best ideas ever, best dance moves ever, best three and four-layer pyramids ever, best falling over ever, best eyeliner ever, best champagne ever, best ass slapping ever, best tongue ever, best cheerleading ever, best long distance romance ever, best fortress of pillows ever, best sparkly glasses ever, best blasted broccoli ever, best donuts in a bag ever, best universe of possibilities ever, best zest ever, best prom photoset ever, best photographers ever, best everything in the universe ever really.  I really do want to double down on friends, love, and becoming a better, kinder, sillier, person.  Life could be as simple as that I think.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Way Back Machine has &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130828011151/http://enjoymentland.com/2009/02/07/history-of-my-self-tracking/&quot;&gt;a copy of this original post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been interested in self-tracking ever since I started posting links to the Internet in 2002, when I attached a + or a – to each link depending on its impact on my morale.  It turns out, whatever makes me want to post a link to something also tends to impact my morale in a positive way, and so my first Morale-O-Meter almost always showed my morale as 10 (tracking the last 10 links posted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, around 2005, I started a more general Morale-O-Meter that allowed me to rate my morale each day from 1-10.  In addition, I also counted the number of alcoholic drinks and caffienated drinks I had, the number of hours of sleep, and my general “health” (1-10, 10 being healthiest).  It created a graph that looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/history-of-my-self-tracking-1-385x288.png&quot; alt=&quot;Morale-o-meter&quot; caption=&quot;Morale-o-meter&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/history-of-my-self-tracking-1-385x288.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/history-of-my-self-tracking-1-385x288.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/history-of-my-self-tracking-1-385x288.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coincidence of this graph was that all of the inputs could be displayed on the same 1-10 scale, and so it tended to make it easy to believe that the inputs could in some way be correlated.  After doing this for about 3 years though, except for minor correlations between number of alcoholic drinks and amount of sleep, there were no deep insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually opened this up to anyone who wanted to track along these same 4 axes, which was mildly successful and interesting, but I never really wholly supported the idea because for some reason I didn’t think that these particular numbers were going to ever lead to an epiphany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I am obsessed with self-tracking is because I think there is a way to track yourself in such a way that it leads to epiphanies about yourself, about the cause and effect of things, in such a way that these numbers would eventually be able to tell you things about yourself that you didn’t already know.  This is the only reason to self-track, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;growing-popularity&quot;&gt;Growing popularity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple years, self-tracking has gotten a lot more attention and interest.  Blogs like Quantified Self have been highlighting a number of different ways that self-tracking is taking off. Sites like Daytum, Me-trics, and Happy Factor are making it easier and easier to join in the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest hurdle to self-tracking is motivation.  By making it fun (and in some cases social), the hurdle comes down and more people are able to enjoy the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fitness-functions&quot;&gt;Fitness Functions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fitness function is, I think, the thing that self-trackers should strive for.  From &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130828011151/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;: “An ideal fitness function correlates closely with the algorithm’s goal, and yet may be computed quickly.” In an abstract sense, fitness functions handle any number of inputs, and output a number that is correlated with the overall fitness of the inputs.  For example, a simple one might be adding (hours of sleep + morale + health – alcoholic drinks).  Some people might say that as that number goes up, so does the overall fitness of the person.  Of course, there are flaws… for example, sleeping 24 hours a day would give you a pretty high score, but would generally result in a pretty unhealthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you’d have to perhaps grade sleep based on how close your sleep was to 8 hours a night.  And, maybe allow one or two alcoholic drinks as healthy, with a penalty for going over that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe simply grading “health” is too abstract to really rely on, maybe it should track your blood pressure, heart rate, number of times you exercised, glasses of water, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how the fitness function can get a little crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;game-ifying-life&quot;&gt;Game-ifying life&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fitness function that was both well-designed AND within reason in terms of amount of effort required to gather the data (that’s where the “gathered quickly” part of the Wikipedia quote becomes relevant) would be highly valuable.  It would give you a score, and a score would allow you to attempt to optimize it.  The fact that the fitness function in some ways obscures the inputs is also helpful in the sense that it makes it more difficult to explicitly “game”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;my-fitness-function&quot;&gt;My Fitness Function&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still balancing on that thin rope between finding the right inputs, the right tools, and the right reasons to continue self-tracking.  Right now, Happy Factor is the only publicly available tool I’m using regularly.  I am hoping that they allow export of data in the future, as it’s pretty silly to have that live on a server somewhere in a way that can’t even be shared with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I’m working on my own personal fitness function in a Google Docs spreadsheet.  I input my weight, stress levels, exercise, and completion of a number of personal goals (like hosting potlucks, working on my iPhone apps, cooking, talking with family, etc) and have each input go into a formula that outputs a 0 or a 1.  For example, if my weight is within my goal weight range, I get a 1.  If I exercise more than once a week, I get a 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This then all gets added up on a weekly basis and graphed into something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/history-of-my-self-tracking-2-385x288.png&quot; alt=&quot;Morale-o-meter&quot; caption=&quot;Morale-o-meter&quot; width=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/pieces/history-of-my-self-tracking-2-385x288.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/history-of-my-self-tracking-2-385x288.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/history-of-my-self-tracking-2-385x288.png 3x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still adjusting it week by week, and hope that eventually it will be possible to actually trust the output of this fitness function to relate my true fitness in life.  The goal being a well-balanced, healthy, creative life shared with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s definitely a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>30: Higher highs and lower lows</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am having such a great weekend (okay, it’s Wednesday but I took Friday, Monday, and Tuesday off and feel like the lines between weeks and ends are only a formality lately anyway… all work is play and playing right is work). With everyone in town (lele, terrajen, enmicropedias and Michelle, Giao, and many others for LBJ and Rick’s wedding) and Seattle people coming out of the winter woodwork I think this weekend is going to serve as a launching pad of ideas and actions that will sail us all through the next couple years at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Daniel and Reggie for inventing some awesome music on the spot (the audio of which was captured by Josh S). Thanks to Vladimir the Polar Bear who gave a great motivational speech (SO FAR!) and sang some wonderful songs (including an improved song about probability and foxes… ideas that she got from the audience) (did anyone catch this on audio or video?). And THANK YOU to everyone who gave 1-minute speeches or subjected themselves to interviews (I want to make a list of everyone that spoke on stage at all, I’ll post the full list later) or baked bacon cakes (thanks mizrobot!) or baked dump cakes (thanks yeswad!) or ate easy cheese or helped with the raffle or wore tuxes or wore wigs or modelled the t-shirts or took pictures or drowned in paddle boats on the way or drank drinks or simply laughed hysterically and cried uncontrollably at the higher highs and the lower lows. Life is uncanny and magical and everyone can help make it even more so for everybody else. I had a wonderful time and hope you did too.&lt;/p&gt;
