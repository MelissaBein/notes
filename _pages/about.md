title: About Buster's Notes
---

These are my notes. Links to a small subset of all the things I've written that seem worth keeping around, assorted into [piles](/piles), occassionally [reviewed](/pile/year-in-review) and re-organized into a tower of [beliefs](/codex), standing the test of [time](/life-in-weeks) (for now, at least). 

This site is the latest incarnation of a personal website that has been around since 1998 in one form or another. Here's a version from [2019](https://paused.busterbenson.com), here's one from [a bit before that](http://archive.busterbenson.com). Find even older versions [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140418111024/http://busterbenson.com/), and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20070104225801/http://bustermcleod.com/), and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20041215024700/http://erikbenson.com/), and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20010202090600/http://mockerybird.com/).
